The main line ran east/west  with the subject white pole (\"P1/gas  treated\") located at the west side of an intersection  where it received a  \"T-line\" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the  \"T-line\". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject  pole. The foreman supported the conductor with a rope for lowering  while  Employee #1  who was elevated in a manbucket on the north side of the pole   released the conductor/strand hanger. Just after the hanger was released  the  pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching  point. The \"T-line\" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin  Employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious. The foreman called  emergency medical services and attempted to lower and move the aerial device   which had become caught because of the lateral load. He then went to retrieve  a digger with the capacity to lift the line  but before he returned  Employee  #1 had regained consciousness and cut the strand. This released the lateral  force and caused the boom to rebound and eject Employee #1 from the bucket.  His personal fall arrest system prevented further injury. Employee #1 was  transported to the hospital  where he was admitted for cervical and lumbar  spinal fractures. The subsequent investigation determined that the root cause  of the accident was a hidden defect in the utility pole  which was guyed and  appeared to be structurally sound. Because employees were not required to  climb the pole  inspection and \"Butt\" testing was not required. Inspection  procedures would have required a visual appraisal  in addition to driving  nails  and sounding of the pole at the first 2 feet above the ground.

The technician was troubleshooting a malfunctioning chain-driven roll-up  (retractable) commercial overhead door. The roll-up door was one of four  similar new doors installed for use within the integrated fire door control  system of the building. The employee  working alone  had erected a fiberglass  8-foot A-frame stepladder and climbed the ladder to access the roll-up door  motor located in the ceiling space above the second floor corridor. The  corridor height from the carpeted floor to ceiling tiles was about 10 feet.  The employee apparently ascended the step ladder to about the fourth or fifth  rung from the bottom of the ladder for a work position  and removed a single  24-inch by 24-inch acoustic ceiling tile. He apparently then removed the motor  cover that enclosed the roll-up door motor. The 110V single-phase roll-up door  motor was energized at the time of the event  and at some point subsequent a  motor overload protector was activated. After removing the motor cover  the  employee apparently disconnected at least two of the low voltage (24 VDC) fire  alarm wires from the alarm terminals. He fell from his position on the ladder  to the carpet-covered concrete floor below. He was killed. There were no  witnesses. Medical examination(s) did not confirm any electrical shock or  electrocution injuries  and the cause of death was determined to be massive  skull fracture and trauma injuries from the fall. Investigation determined  that the ladder the employee had used had visible defects  including but not  limited to a bent right-side spreader bar  a broken left-side spreader bar  a  bent/damaged ladder rung  a large burn hole in the top of the ladder  missing  anti-slip pads on the ladder feet  and several cracks in the fiberglass side  rails. Items recovered at the scene and presumed used by the employee included  but were not limited to a small flashlight  a multi-meter  a phillips screw  driver  vice grips  and a small pocket knife. It was also learned that at the  time of the event the employee was talking on a cell phone to the roll-up door  manufacturer's tech support regarding the malfunctioning roll-up door and fire  alarm integration.",

On column B-5  there was a stack of laminated top MDO (medium density overlay)  plywood  each piece measuring 4 feet by 8 feet by 14.75 inches. The stack had  been piled (long side) vertically against the column by a forklift  with  Employee #2 helping to guide the load. As Employees #1 and #2 were removing  one sheet of plywood from the stack  the stack fell toward them. Employee #1  tried to push Employee #2 out of the way  but neither escaped in time to avoid  injury. They both fell onto the concrete slab underneath the plywood pile.  Nearby workers tried to lift up the pile and failed. Single sheets had to be  removed from the pile  one at a time. Emergency services were called  and the  San Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Kaiser  Hospital in San Francisco. He was treated and released the same day. Employee  #1 subsequently returned to the hospital for further treatment for a shattered  right heel  fractured toes  and a fractured ankle. He was hospitalized for 8  days and underwent two surgeries where rods and bolts were implanted into his  right foot and toes. Employee #2 was transported to San Francisco General  Hospital. He was treated for a bruised neck  shoulder  ribs  arm  foot  and  side. He was released the same day. This incident was reported to Cal/OSHA by  the San Francisco Fire Department on August 19  2013. Cal/OSHA sent an  investigator to the job site on August 19  2013  to begin the investigation.  It was determined that there were no witnesses to the incident. The foreman  was on another floor of the building. Interviews were conducted with Employees  #1 and #2  the project superintendent  the foreman  the field safety manager   the forklift operator  and the general contractor's management staff.

The foreman stated  that the plywood had a laminated top MDO (medium density overlay) and each  sheet weighed approximately 45 pounds. The total weight of 13 pieces of  plywood would have been just under 600 pounds. T8 CCR 1549(d) requires piles  of plywood stacked on edge to be positively secured to prevent tipping or  falling. The employer was cited one serious accident-related violation of this  regulation. The employer also was cited for failure to report to Cal/OSHA  Employee #1's 8-day hospital stay.

This  accident site was an oil refinery that processes crude oil into saleable  petroleum products. The turnaround work involved in the accident consisted of  refractory removal inside a flue duct that was associated with the FCCU. The  work crew was moved to a new confined space area in the Duct works because the  refractory needed to be immediately removed at the location. The employer  required the workers removing refractory to work within four feet of the  leading edge associated with the 28 foot vertical fall hazard. Because of the  heavy weight of the rivet buster  the work crew traded off using the tool  until one got tired. The employee had finished using the rivet buster  and he  handed the tool to a coworker. For an unknown reason  he walked the wrong  direction into vertical flue duct section. The employee fell 28 feet onto a  staging area. The employee's supervisor did not work in the permit confined  with the workers. The employee and three coworkers were in a confined space  adjacent to the fall hazard. All the employees  including the supervisor   required for all the permitted flue duct spaces to be \"100 percent tie off\".  Nobody was tied-off  because no anchor points were established in the duct.  The following factors contributed to the   1) lack of barrier  restricting the movement by the fall hazard at the duct  and 2) lack of fall  protection for workers inside the duct as required by the confined space  permit. The employee sustained a broken femur and compound fracture of his  left arm.",

The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was  transported to a hospital  where he received treatment for a knee  bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.

He was working alone  standing near the  garage entrance  and cutting a piece of trim to custom fit the new garage door  to the existing frame. The trim was a 3-foot to 4-foot long piece of 2-inch by  1-inch lumber  originally cut from a 16-foot long piece. Employee #1 was in  the process of cutting the lumber using a Craftsman 14 Amp 7.25-inch Circular  Saw  Model Number 320.10870. This was a left-handed saw that belonged to  Employee #1  although he was right-handed. He was handling the saw in his left  hand and holding the wood being cut with his right hand while kneeling down.  While making the cut  Employee #1 was pushing the saw with his left hand and  resisting the force with the wood in his right hand. He held the wood in an  underhanded position  with his right thumb grasping the wood over the top  his  palm supporting it from beneath  and his other fingers curling around the  back. He planned to slide his hand around toward the back of the wood to move  his hand/fingers further away from the saw blade. As he attempted to do this   the saw blade amputated his right hand's pinkie finger just past the first  knuckle. He required hospitalization for the amputation. At 3:53 p.m. on  October 23  2012  the employer reported this event to Cal/OSHA. Employee #1  later told the Cal/OSHA investigator that he may have misjudged how close his  hand was to the advancing blade  how far his fingers were crosswise to the  blade  and the depth the blade was set to cut. From the interview with  Employee #1  the investigator concluded that Employee #1's assessment of what  he might have done differently to avoid injury was faulty. Specifically   Employee #1 did not utilize the following safe practices indicated in the  Operator's Manual for the saw: \"Do not reach underneath the work. Always clamp  the work piece securely so it will not move when making the cut. Avoid awkward  operations and hand positions where a sudden slip could cause your hand to  move into the blade.\" According to the investigation report  the primary  factor leading to this injury was the employer's failure to provide training  to Employee #1. The employer was relying on the employee's past experience.  This  in turn  led to the employee using poor and/or faulty judgment to assess  the hazards involved.",

Employee #1 was in charge of attending to a kettle that  contained hot tar  while most of the coworkers were on the roof. The kettle  was a portable piece of equipment that is equipped with LPG fueled heaters.  Solid pieces of tar that were delivered to the jobsite are loaded into the  kettle and heated into a liquid tar. It took approximately three hours for the  solid tar to become liquid and during this process  the motor and pump on the  kettle operated in order to circulate the tar through the kettle. The  liquefied tar was pumped through a closed piping system to the roof area. When  the pump was not delivering hot tar to the roof area  the pump continues to  operate and a diverter was used to recirculate the hot tar through the kettle.  This recirculation was conducted in order to prevent the tar from settling on  the bottom of the kettle. The diverter valve was manually operated through an  accessible handle located on the valve and diverted the hot tar between  circulating through the kettle and up to the roof area  dependent on the needs  of the workers. As the kettle was in recirculation mode  without notifying  Employee #1  one of the coworkers walked over to the pipe that supplies tar to  the roof and pulled on a rope that was connected to the diverter valve.

After a while  the supervisor stopped the backhoe and indicated to  them that he wanted them to look for the jackhammer drill bit and pin which  had fallen out of the jackhammer. He told them to look in the pile of concrete  rubble. The other employee found the bit  but not the pin. The supervisor then  went and got the \"Kamatsu\" excavator and brought it over to the pile of  concrete. The supervisor started moving the slabs and pieces of concrete in  order to make clearance for them to continue looking for the pin. Employee #1  had been using an air rivet-buster to break the concrete  as well as a  portable gas cut-off saw to cut the tangled rebar. Employee #1 decided to use  these tools because the concrete and rebar were difficult to separate with  just the sledge hammer.

        "summary": "At 12:01 p.m. on October 19  2010  Employee #1 suffered multiple fractures  when his right leg was struck by an auger extension that separated from the  auger head. Employee #1 was working at a residential construction site located  in Los Altos  California. Employee #1 was employed by RCM Concrete. According  to the Foreman/Supervisor (Employee #2)  he and Employee #1 had been drilling  holes for the retaining wall using a Bobcat (loader) with an auger and a six  foot auger extension. Employee #2 was operating the Bobcat and Employee #1 was  the spotter  working near the drill area. Employee #2 had completed drilling  holes  so he instructed Employee #1 to remove the screw locking the auger and  the extension. The connection was too tight so that the screw could not be  removed by Employee #1. Employee #2 instructed Employee #1 to remove soil and  dirt around the auger and extension connection. Employee #1 used his hands to  remove the dirt around the auger/extension connection and to remove or loosen  the screw holding the extension and auger. Employee #1 said the arm of the  Bobcat suddenly moved while he was still working on removing the screw. The  movement of the arm of the Bobcat separated the auger extension from the  auger. According to Employee #1  he was struck by the auger extension and he  was thrown on the ground approximately 10 to 15 feet away. In an interview   Employee #2 stated that he could not see how the extension connection to the  auger head was angled  so he asked Employee #1 to give him a hand signal.  Employee #2 said he moved the Bobcat arm forward after getting a signal from  Employee #1. Employee #1 was standing less than a foot away from the auger  extension. As Employee #2 moved the Bobcat arm forward  the auger extension  became separated from the auger and it swung toward Employee #1  injuring his  right leg and resulting in multiple fractures. Employee #1 also suffered a  scalp laceration. Employee #1 was taken by ambulance to Stanford Hospital in  Palo Alto  California where he was hospitalized for 5 days.",

Employee #1  was onsite to replace the short circuit ratio (SCR) controller system board  and the photo board on a Kohler emergency backup generator. These boards were  within 9 in. of the exposed live current parts. The generator was set up in  Phase 3  power factor 0.8  kilowatts 33  kilovolt-ampere 41  amperes 50 and  factory test and reconnect F. Its model number was 33RZ272 and serial number  was 245558 and was setup in voltage of 277/480. The generator was operating in  normal operating limits with no problems. Employee #1 removed the positive  battery cable on the generator and turned the generator in the off position.  He then removed the front housing on the generator to access the area for  replacing the SCR board and the photo board. Employee #1 used a socket wrench  that was 7.5 in. long with a 2.375 in. deep well six-point socket to remove a  2.125 in. course thread bolt in the generator. As he removed the bolt  the  wrench contacted a live terminal from the rear switch on the generator  which  electrocuted him with approximately 277 volts. The incident occurred between  1:30 p.m.  the time he arrived onsite and 9:00 a.m. on the next day. The  assistant principal was on the kitchen dock  located behind the school  around  5:00 p.m. when he noticed Employee 1's company van still outside the  electrical room  but did not check on him at that time. The next morning  a  coworker called the school and spoke with the assistant principal  telling him  that he had not heard from Employee #1 since early the day before. The  assistant principal told the coworker to hold on while he went to the area  where Employee 1 was working. When he arrived on scene  he noticed Employee #1  slumped over on his knees with a reach still into the generator. At the point   the assistant principal called the school resource officer and school nurse to  the area. The resource officer instructed the assistant principal to have  power to the entire school shut down before removing Employee #1 due to the  concern that he was still energized. Power was shut down and he was removed  and power was restored to the school. From the investigation  blue wires were  found inside a closed electric box located 18 inches away. The blue wires went  outside and then underground to another building to power lights. These blue  wires on the hot side of the emergency lights breaker box created a back feed  to the generator  which would have caused the generator to be hot even if the  switches were in the off position on the generator.

Employee #1 pulled the rags  underneath the bucket to put down the fire. The solvent splashed on his upper  body and caught him on fire. Employee #1 suffered second and third degree  burns to 40-percent of his upper body. Employee #1 was transported to St. Mary  Long Beach Hospital and later was transferred to UCLA Burn Center  where he  was hospitalized and treated for three and a half weeks.",

The company had been contracted to  install a swimming pool and spa in Ft Myers  FL. Employee #1 had delivered  gunite material  a combination of sand and cement mix  to the location. A  four-person team was also at the accident site to spray and shape the gunite  as it was dispensed from the gunite truck. The crew was positioned forty to  sixty feet away from the truck; they last saw the driver heading toward the  truck with a shovel. Although the truck was empty at the time of the accident   the crew's supervisor assumed that the driver was going to the truck to bang  the shovel against the sides of the bin. This act would have loosened any sand  that had become stuck inside on the wall of the bin. It was often done by  drivers  but only from the outside. Minutes later  the supervisor released one  of the crew members to see if the driver needed assistance. The truck was  empty  and no product was being dispensed by the truck. The crew member  arrived at the truck but could not locate the driver. The truck's auger  which  was still in operation at this time  made it difficult to hear. The crew  member remained at the rear of the truck waiting for the driver. It was at  this time that he noticed a piece of clothing being expelled from the auger.  He quickly turned the truck off and immediately notified his supervisor. The  shovel was found on the top edge of the sand bin undamaged. The supervisor  found Employee #1 inside the truck's sand bin  caught in the 9-inch auger  located in the bottom of the bin. The supervisor called emergency medical  services. The driver was alive when he was extracted from the auger  but he  died on the scene while being attended to by emergency responders due to leg  amputations. The mobile gunite truck was a 1989 International industrial truck  which contained two bins. One bin held sand  and the other held cement mix.  The truck had a 9-inch diameter auger  17 feet  7 inches in length  which ran  through the bottom of both bins. The auger transferred sand from the sand bin  to the cement mix bin. The two materials were combined and sent to another  auger  the mixing auger  located at the rear of the truck. The mixing auger  was located outside the truck bins. It extended 9 feet  9 inches in the rear  of the truck. Although there was a ladder located at the rear of the truck   the only time it was used was when the driver visually inspected the load to  ensure that a full load was received when material was being loaded into the  truck. The loading area was located at the employer's establishment in Cape  Coral  FL. The mobile gunite truck had several warning labels posted on the  outside of the truck warning of the dangers of the auger  including serious  injury  amputation  and death. The driver had been employed eight months. He  had received guidelines and training on driver responsibilities on November  20  2009.",

        "summary": "At approximately 11:00 a.m. on June 26  2007  Employee #1  a heavy equipment  operator  began operating an excavator after first inspecting the machine. He  had been mining and mucking for about an hour when he noticed a slow drip  coming from the right front port plug. Employee #1 pulled back and raised the  boom slightly to investigate it. At this time  Employee #1 did not notice any  significant damage to the plug  and the drip stopped when pressure was applied  to the cylinder. He called on the mine phone and spoke to his coworker  a  contractor at the site  who was at the bottom of an exit shaft  about 2 400 ft  back. He told Employee #1 that he would get a new plug. Employee #1 resumed  his work  moved the boom forward  and then was moving the boom either up or  down when the plug blew out. It struck Employee #1's left hand with sufficient  force to break off the left joystick and cause significant trauma. He was  evacuated from the tunnel and taken to the hospital  where he underwent the  surgical amputation of his left middle finger back to the wrist and the  relocation of his index finger to the middle position. After the accident the  plug was found to have been damaged  probably by rocks and boulders while  mining or mucking. The damage to the head caused the threaded portion to take  on an oval shape that was approximately 1/8 in. out of round. The full depth  of the threads on the ends of the oval were damaged consistent with the plug  being ejected. The threads on the sides of the oval were undamaged  indicating  that these were not engaged due to the shape of the plug after it was damaged.  While mining prior to the accident  the pressure in the hydraulic system  reached approximately 3 000 psi. The computer logs were not entirely clear but  showed that just before the accident the pressure was no more than about 1 600  psi. Why the plug did not fail during mining  and how a plug with most of its  threads not engaged only dripped slowly when under pressure both remain  undetermined. The accident occured during the excavation of an 11 mi long by  approximately 12 ft diameter tunnel. Excavation had been completed from the  portal to about 8 900 ft using a conventional rotary boring machine and drill  and blast methods. A digger shield-type tunnel boring machine was then  launched and had evacuated approximately 525 additional feet. The digger  shield TBM  built by CTS  Inc.  specifically for this project  utilizes an  excavator arm with a tooth attachment on its end to dig at the tunnel face.  Underneath the tooth is a flat shovel attachment or paddle that the operator  uses to pull muck onto the lower steel apron of the shield and onto the  conveyor belt. On each side of the arm are hydraulics that provide vertical  motion for the boom. On the upper part of each cylinder  angled outwards about  45 degrees are two ports for the hydraulic connections  one on each end.  Mirroring these ports  facing downward and outward  are unused threaded ports  that are plugged with 1.5 in. hex-head screws in steel plugs. When the  operator is mucking  the boom is pulled back toward him so that at the end of  the pull  the cylinder on his side is approximately 1 ft to his left. In the  fully down position  the front plug is about even with the operators left  joystick  both in height and position. There were no witnesses to the accident  and no citations were issued as a result of this investigation",

When the employees attempted to remove one of the plugs   it acted as if it had pressure behind it. A cap on a 3/4 inch bleeder in the  plug was loosened to vent pressure. Diesel oil flowing down the line struck  the plug and knocked it aside. The 3/4 inch bleeder went through the hand of  Employee #2  resulting in a compound fracture and impalement. Employee #1's  arm was blown against the bevel on the pipe at the opposite side of the  excavation; sutures were required.",

Also at the site were a  coworker  who was a drill operator  and a foreman. All three employees were  employed by a commercial contractor that specializes in street and traffic  light installations in Southern California. Employee #1 was a locator  who  walked on the ground surface to locate the underground directional drill head  using a detector unit to track the horizontal and angle movement of the drill  head. This information was communicated back to the coworker  who was the  operator seated on the directional boring machine (a Vermeer Number D24x40  Horizontal Directional Drill). The horizontal directional drill was used to  dig under cement  pavement  and earth to lay electrical lines for street and  traffic lights. The head of the drill first made a path through the soil  underneath the ground  until it arrived at its destination. A line was then  pulled through it  so electrical lines could be installed to hookup traffic  and signal lights for public streets and freeways. The front section of the  horizontal directional boring machine was outfitted with a left and right  anchor boring unit with stakes. The stakes were large auger units that tapped  into the ground vertically to stabilize the machine when its drilling rods  apparently ran horizontally  underneath the ground. The bolt holding the auger  bit to the shaft on the main frame of the directional boring machine came off   and the coworker had to take it apart to get to the dislodged bolt.  Apparently  the coworker tightened the bolt  got up on the directional boring  machine  seated himself  and unsuccessfully attempted to line up the square  piece fitting of the shaft over the top of the auger attachment. Employee #1  came over and used his left hand to try and line up the shaft  while the  coworker manipulated the controls  in an attempt to attach the shaft to the  auger bit. The shaft dropped on employee's #1 left thumb  causing the top one  inch to be amputated. The foreman transported Employee #1 to U.S. HealthWorks  First and later transported him to the Orthopedic Center in La Jolla. Employee  #1 was hospitalized and required outpatient surgery the day after the  accident. The Division was notified about the accident on May 18  2007. During  the initial investigation  Employee #1 had not yet returned to work  but the  Division found he had returned to work during a subsequent visit to another of  the employer's job sites on June 11  2007.",

The  light pole was a plastic pipe with two lights  4 square ft  held 3 ft apart  and angled out to a total width of about 76 ins. It weighed approximately 125  pounds  and its center of gravity was estimated to have been about 9.5 ft from  the bottom. Two brackets made from angle iron had been welded to the  guardrail. One bracket was at approximately 29 ins. above the ground  and the  other was at approximately 53 ins. above the ground. Two holes were drilled  into each bracket to accommodate a U-bolt to hold the light pole in place.  Employee #1  and a coworker  lifted the light pole up into place  and Employee  #1 installed the upper U-bolt. The bottom of the pole was on the outside of a  piece of electrical conduit. The pole had to be lifted up over the conduit so  the wiring could be attached. Employee #1's supervisor told Employee #1 and  his coworker to wait while the supervisor got some wood blocks to rest the  pole on  in order to raise the pole into the proper position before attaching  the lower U-bolt. While the supervisor was gone  the coworker attempted to  lift the light pole up and over the conduit  so that it would rest in between  the conduit and the wall. The coworker used a 4 ft crowbar to lift the pole up  at its base. The coworker held the pole with one hand and held the crowbar  with the other. Employee #1 was reaching out over the coworker's shoulder to  give him room to work and was holding the pole with one hand to steady it.  Employee #1 did not have control of the pole. Each employee thought the other  was in control of the top-heavy light pole. When the coworker pried the pole  up  it rotated counter-clockwise around the upper bracket. Employee #1's right  thumb was caught between the pole and the upper rail of the guardrail.  Employee #1 suffered an avulsion (skin torn off to the skeleton) to the pad of  his right thumb. He underwent surgery to amputate a portion of the right  thumb. This accident was caused by the misjudgment of a hazardous situation   specifically  attempting to use a crowbar to lift a tall  top-heavy light  pole. Secondary factors were poor body positioning for the task  and a lack of  proper communication between Employee #1 and the coworker about who was  supporting the pole.",

The workers had been at  the site on two previous occasions to expose framing members by removing  drywall and then to enclosed the subject area with plastic sheeting. Because  test results from an independent testing lab showed that mold was still  present  Employees #1 and #2 returned to the apartment unit a third time to  encapsulate the mold. Employees #1 and #2 were spraying Kilz(R) Original  Aerosol to encapsulate visible mold that was on the framing members of an  interior partition wall of the apartment unit  while inside the  plastic-enclosed containment area. The homeowner was in the kitchen area of  the apartment. Employees #1 and #2 exhausted four and one-half  13-ounce-sized  cans of the flammable aerosol within the containment area  which measured 41  inches deep by 8 feet long by 8 feet  10 inches high. They then plugged into  an electrical outlet an OmniAire 1000V HEPA air filtration machine  which was  also inside the containment area. An explosion and fire occurred  when an  ignition source was introduced inside the containment area where flammable  vapors were concentrated. Employees #1 and #2 sustained serious burns (second  and third degree) to their upper bodies and faces. They required inpatient  hospitalization for more than 24 hours. According to the manufacturer   OmniAire 1000V was an air filtering machine designed for filtering  particulates and providing negative air pressure for asbestos abatement. The  machine was listed as meeting requirements for UL (Underwriters Laboratories)  Standard UL507 for Safety for Electric Fans. The listing did not include use  in hazardous atmospheres  where flammable vapors were present. The machine had  a variable speed controller and Emerson  open-frame type fan motor. The  investigation found that the employer's IIPP (Injury and Illness Prevention  Program) lacked several required elements and that the workers were not  trained on the physical or health hazards of the Kilz(R) Original Aerosol.  Further  the improper use of listed equipment in a hazardous atmosphere caused  the explosion and fire. The employer was issued citations accordingly.",

Workers from Tremco  Inc. were working with workers from Reliable  Roofing and Sheet Metal  LLC  inspecting the water damage to the roof of a  building. Reliable rented a Grove Aerial Lift  Model Number A125J. The  Reliable Roofing foreman moved the lift into position to place it into  operation. Two of the wheels were on the sidewalk  and two of the wheels were  in the street. The wheels on the street were on a stack of three 1.75-in.  thick boards. The Reliable foreman operated the lift from the basket  with  Employee #1 riding in the basket. The operator moved the boom to reposition it  to access a lower level of the roof. The operator had not been trained in the  proper procedures for operating this machine. He lowered the lower riser while  the other boom sections of the lift were still telescoped out. The sensors  that should have presented this maneuver did not function. Another limit  switch should have prevented the operator from lowering below a 72 degree  angle with the boom extended  but it also malfunctioned. The operator lowered  to an angle of 55 degrees  whereupon the machine exceeded its tipping moment.  As it fell  the machine's man basket struck the corner of a neighboring  building. Half of the basket was sheared off and the operator was thrown to  the second story rooftop. The rest of the basket and Employee #1 were thrown  into a fire door leading to the fire escape of the fourth floor of the  neighboring building. Both workers were transported to Massachusetts General  Hospital for treatment. Employee #1 died. The operator of the lift had never  received specific formal training for the lift that he had been operating that  day  and did not know its operational limitations. He did not perform any  preoperation checks or inspections which would have identified the  malfunctioning switches.",

Employee #1 was  a contractor employee leased through Clover Resource Solutions  Inc. Employee  #2 was an employee of Anderson Pump Company of Chowchilla  CA  the company  installing the pump. An elevator clamp failed  allowing a 20-foot section of  8-inch well case to fall and strike the two employees. Employee #1 suffered a  concussion. He was not hospitalized. This incident was reported on the same  day to Cal/OSHA Division by the Human Resources and Safety Director for  Anderson Pump Company. Investigation determined that a dual employer  relationship was created by contract between the primary employer  Clover  Resource Solutions  Inc.  and the secondary employer  Anderson Pump and  Machine  in accordance with the Division's P&P; C-1D. As reported  an elevator  clamp failed  allowing a 20- foot section of 8-inch well case to fall and  strike the two employees. The elevator clamp was a forged ferrous metal  clamping device for lifting 8- to 10-inch well casing. In this device  a chain  would allow for adjustment of the clamp in diameter to accommodate different  diameters and terminated in a two-fingered flange attached to a threaded rod  with nut. The fingered flange would fit into a saddle provided on the clamps  housing. Tightening the nut causes the device to clamp around the pipe   securing it for hoisting. Results of the visual inspection of the clamp  revealed a clean break of the fingers without an indication of cracking or  other indication of fatigue and failure. The threads on the adjustment rod and  nut did not show signs of deformation or galling. According to industry  sources  these clamps are common in the well drilling and service industry  although not currently in production. No requirement current or historical was  found to cause users to inspect or test these clamps for structural integrity.  Several other clamps were inspected with same results  that is  no defect was  observed. Several sources in the industry asserted they had never heard of an  elevator clamp failing. Although not conclusive  a possible explanation for  the clamp's failure was the fingers were not fully seated in the saddle   causing excessive load on the tips. Root cause of the injury event was  determined to be unforeseeable catastrophic failure of the elevator clamp. The  employer was found to have a well devised health and safety program with an  effective Injury and Illness Prevention Program  including employee training  and equipment maintenance.",

        "summary": "On May 12  2005  Employee #1  of Acorn Industrial  Inc.  was removing welds  from a 30 in. CHR pipe in a utility tunnel  so the pipe could be repositioned  and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports  spaced throughout the tunnel  as well as by temporary \"trapeze\" supports  mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not  adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place  where Employee #1 was working  there was no permanent support in place. On the  previous day  a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from  Employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe  had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west  joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a  misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this  Employee #1 and  the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. of the 30 in. CHR pipe at the west  joint (including the misaligned weld)  refit the two pipe ends  and redo the  weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all  portions of it  due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the  rolling of the pipe  three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were  re-welded back in place  but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of  the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After  the tack welds cracked the second time  the foreman and Employee #1 decided to  start over at the west joint. At this point Employee #1 had completely severed  the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told Employee #1 to check his rigging  and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a  hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in.  CHR pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue  layout for expansion joints in another vault  and Employee #1 and his helper  continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds  while they were at the bottom of the pipe  instead of rolling the pipe to put  the tack welds in a better position. At this point  the only support for the  pipe was the permanent support  about 24 ft 4 in. away  and approximately 12  ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The  pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. at the east joint.  Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it  fell  crushing his right arm against the 30 in. CHS pipe below. He suffered  injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary \"trapeze\" support would  have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the  workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint  and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a  Ross \"come-a-long\" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The  \"come-a-long\" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe;  it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----",

The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice  connector sitting atop the insulator  so Employee #1 pulled off this connector  and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the  apprentice coworker to climb down  since this particular job was completed.  The other coworkers  a groundman and the foreman  were also on the ground.  Then  for some reason  the material handler load indicator contacted the  energized phase  and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire   resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and  third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body  primarily his upper torso.  Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose  covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed  to be wearing rubber gloves  but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this  was true.",

Employee # 2 loaded  the truck with approximately 5.09 tons of number seven rocks  and Employee #1  proceeded to drive to Baron Ballpark  which was approximately 0.9 to 1.2 miles  away. Employee # 1 backed the dump truck into the desired dump area. Employee  # 1 parked the truck  and from inside the cab  shifted the \"HOIST\" lever into  the \"RAISE\" position in order to raise the dump bed.

Employee # 1 exited the cab of the truck and notice that she had not opened  the tailgate prior to raising the dump bed. Employee # 1 then got back into  the cab of the truck and shifted the \"HOIST\" lever to the \"LOWER\" position in  order to try to lower the dump bed so she could remove the chain from the  tailgate release lever and engage the lever.

Their assignment was to demolish an old   leaning cinder block wall that was approximately 7 feet high by 50 feet long.  Coworker #1 was experienced in this type of work and had been demolishing  walls for more than 29 years. Coworker #1 was operating a skid-steer tractor  with a hydraulic breaker attachment. He removed approximately 3 feet of cinder  block from the top of the wall to confirm the presence of reinforcing steel  and reduce the height of the wall. He observed that there was both vertical  and horizontal rebar in the wall and that the wall was stable. Coworker #1  removed the soil that was exposed after removing the top of the wall. He then  removed vertical slot sections of the wall approximately 6 inches wide to  obtain an approximately 4-foot section of wall  which he then would pull over  with the skid-steer. During these procedures Coworker #1 would continually  watch the wall for any indication of instability and pull on the wall with the  skid-steer to ensure it would not tip over. He saw no indication of any  structural problems. When the wall had been reduced to approximately 4 feet  from the ground  it contained a horizontal steel reinforcing bar that needed  to be cut before Coworker #1 could pull the wall down and enable the cutting  of the vertical reinforcing steel bars. Employee #1 was cutting these  horizontal steel reinforcing bars with a hand- held portable cut-off saw. The  first 4-foot section of wall had been removed following this procedure without  a problem. Coworker #1 prepared another 4-foot section of wall in the same  way. Employee #1 cut the top horizontal rebar  and then the next horizontal  rebar below  and began to position himself to cut the next rebar below. The  next 4-foot wide section of wall suddenly toppled and fell on him. Emergency  services were called  and the Los Angeles City Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to LAC+USC Medical Center  where he was admitted  and treated for a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. The Los Angeles City  Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA at approximately 8:45 a.m.  on September 10  2013. The employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA at 7:55  a.m. on September 11  2013  after the employer learned that Employee #1 would  be hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The Cal/OSHA investigator arrived at  the work site at approximately 9:50 a.m. on September 19  2013 and began the  investigation. The investigation determined that the vertical steel  reinforcing bars in the wall were rusted away at the base and did not hold the  wall section up the way they had in the first section. The employer did not  block or brace the next wall section before allowing Employee #1 to work  adjacent to the wall  and he was injured when the wall fell over onto him. At  the time of this report  Cal/OSHA planned to issue a serious citation T8 CCR  1735(d)(4). Demolishing Buildings. (4) During demolition  continuing  inspections shall be made as the work progresses to detect hazards resulting  from weakened or deteriorated floors or walls  or loosened material.

Employee #1 was operating a Rough Terrain Forklift (Model TL1055  Serial  Number TBM00475) with a maximum weight without attachment 37 290/16 910 Max  capacity of 10 000 pounds Manufactured by JLG. This Rough Terrain Forklift had  been owned by PAR Electrical Contractors since 2007 or 2008. It was purchased  from a rental company  no operating manual was available at the time of the  incident. The tires were Firestone 14.00-24TH Super Ground 12-Ply rating  tubeless  (Made in USA VE0000 Cat TL1055 Number 30628 NY4J79). The fork  attachment was a Model Number 1001090014  Serial Number 2007176-03  with a  maximum capacity of 12 000/5 443  a maximum weight of 1 217 pounds  manufactured by JLG Industries. The fork distance above ground 12-ft with  45-degree boom angle  distance between the ground and bottom of rebar cage was  approximately 4-ft. 3-in. Employee #1 drove the Rough Terrain Forklift up  hill  on an approximate 10.5 feet wide dirt road. A crew was transporting an  approximate 11 800 pound 45-ft. by 5 ft. rebar cage in the back of a flatbed  truck. The rear load portion of the cage extended beyond the length of the  flatbed truck and was rigged with a four-way steel chain and shackle that was  suspended by the forklift's vertical mast. The boom angle was approximately 45  degrees extended at the B section of the boom indicator. The forks were  approximately 12 ft. above the ground. The dirt road contained a slope grade  of approximately 3.5 feet drop within a 15 ft. section. While the forklift  traveled forward on the steep slope at the rear of the flatbed truck  it began  to tip over on its left side. As Employee #1 exited the operator cab  his  right foot inadvertently got trapped between the roll over protective  structure and the road. Employee #1 was transported to Antelope Valley  Hospital and admitted the same day. Employee #1 sustained a below the right  knee amputation as a result of crushing injuries. Employee #1 received five  surgeries and remained in the hospital for 21 days. The flatbed truck involved  in the rollover event was a Caterpiller Number 12 Truck Flatbed truck  USDOT  352475 JREFB533 License 86AJ22 Freightliner 24-25 ft. The truck measured  approximately 4-ft. in height from ground to flatbed  and the Rebar Cage  diameter was approximately 6-ft. The causal factors of the event include: (1)  Employee #1 placed part of his body outside the running lines of the forklift   where crushing hazards existed. (2) The load and load engaging means was not  tilted back and raised only as far as necessary to clear the road surface. (3)  The forks of the forklift were not carried as low as possible. (4) The  operator restraint system seat belt was not used. (5) The air pressure of all  four of the all-terrain forklift tires were not properly inflated. (6) The  slope angle and the attachment of suspended load.

The hospital was undergoing renovations. The plastic sheet  was placed over the atrium to maintain negative pressure and prevent  construction dust from entering the nearby and connected VA Medical Center   which was an active location in the hospital. The open-air atrium measured  approximately 24 ft by 45 ft. Second floor and roof deck guardrails had  surrounded the top of the atrium  but had been demolished over the summer.  Additionally  DBI-Sala anchors that employees had used to demolish the  guardrail had been removed. After demolishing the guardrail  the top of the  atrium was enclosed by a locked construction fence. During a prejob meeting  that occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 11  2012  a crew attached  plastic poly sheeting under the existing sheeting drooping inside the  building. The crew used a scissor lift to attach this plastic to the inside  edge of a 2in by 4 ft wood frame around the atrium  instead of the second  floor and roof deck surrounding the edge of the atrium opening. Further  the  crew did not discuss what would be required for employees that access and work  from second floor and roof deck. Employee #1 and the coworker were instructed  to stay in the scissors lift and install the plastic from below. However  they  were not told that this was because no guardrails or approved fall protection  anchors were in the area around the atrium opening. When Employee #1  his  coworker and the rest of the crew were assembled to discuss the job  they  informed the foreman that the job could not be accomplished from below the  existing plastic using the scissors lifts. The foreman then directed the crew  to install the rolled poly plastic over the existing plastic and from the  second floor and roof deck. The foreman stated that he did not discuss or  receive permission for this change in the work procedure with the operations  manager. The site superintendent was also not aware of the change in the work  procedure. Further  the foreman and others had not been on the roof before the  work commenced. The foreman directed Employees #1 and a coworker to wear and  use fall protection. Employee #1 was wearing a Miller (Model Number E650) full  body harness with a Rebel Protecta 10 ft long retractable lanyard device  attached the harness. Employee #1 and the coworker pulled the plastic over the  open atrium  when Employee #1 fell. Even though Employee #1 was wearing fall  protection  his fall was not arrested due to the failure of the DBI-Sala  anchors. He fell approximately 20 ft from the roof atrium opening onto the  floor and was killed.",

They were trying to set into place on the  second story of the building an 800-pound steel-framed wall measuring 6 feet 6  inches tall by 31 feet long. The wall fell over and landed on Employee #1's  leg. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  admitted  and treated for a fractured leg. This event was  investigated by Washington State OSHA. According to the investigation report's  documentation of events  Employee #1 had pre-assembled the wall on the ground  and had added .5-inch plywood to the face for rigidity and a 6-inch piece of  cold roll steel channel on top for connecting the wall to the structure. On  the night of December 17  2013  the wall had been lifted by crane into the  space on the roof directly in front of the installation area. On the morning  of December 18  2013  the wall was not reattached to the crane for stability   and the only other support  a lanyard tied around a steel column and through  the window of the wall  was removed. The investigation determined that the  project manager/superintendent and the assistant safety director had assigned  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 the task of installing the wall. The field  engineer and the project manager/superintendent verbally admitted they did not  have a site-specific erection plan  did not inform Employee #1 and Coworker #1  of the wall's weight  and did not design any temporary type of guying or  bracing to secure the wall and protect the workers.",

One step in the preparation for this move  involved the employees having to \"jack-up\" the mobile home high enough for its  axles and tires to be re-installed. During this jacking-up process  the mobile  home slid off shimmed support blocks and pinned Employee #1 to the ground   killing him. Just prior  Employee #1 had been lying on his right side  and  reaching up to insert shimming blocks under the home's South I-beam  while a  second employee (the Crew Leadman) operated the crew's only 12-ton \"bottle  jack\" under the home's North floor- support I-beam. He too was inserting  shimming blocks as he jacked-up the structure. The third employee was also  inserting shimming blocks under the mobile home's North I-beam  but he was  located nearer its North West corner. The slope of the ground under the mobile  home was measured. The ground fell 1.5 inches from North to South under this  mobile home  and when the home fell  it slid from North to South - and came to  rest with its South I-bean coming down across Employee #1's chest.",

In the electric room   he found a dead leg on the main breaker. At the fuse box  he pulled the  disconnect handle down to the open position and opened the door in order to  replace the fuse. Employee #1 checked the voltage on all three phases and  determined that all three phases were dead. He then tested the continuity on  each fuse and determined that the fuse on phase B was bad. Employee #1 pulled  the bad fuse with his hand and gave it to a coworker. He placed a new fuse  against the clips and tested voltage on all three phases to ensure they were  still dead. When he pushed the fuse into the fuse clip holder  it did not set  correctly. Employee #1 used a pair of channel locks that he placed between the  fuses to gain additional leverage to push the fuse in. As Employee #1 applied  force  the channel locks slipped and contacted the fuses. The resulting  electrical arc flash burned Employee #1 on his hands  arms and face. He was  treated at Antelope Valley Hospital and then hospitalized at Sherman Oaks  Hospital Burn Center for treatment of second and third degree burns.",

Employee #1 remained hospitalized for six days. The employer  notified Cal/OSHA of the incident at 3:45 p.m. on August 27  2013. During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Employee #1 had  been working as a painter for T & T Improvements for approximately five  months. At the time of Employee #1's fall  he was working adjacent to  coworkers and the site supervisor. Interviews were conducted with Employee #1   Employee #1's supervisor (partial interview)  and injured coworkers. The  investigation concluded that Employee #1 had not been using or required to use  approved fall protection  and the Primary Employer  Barrett Business Services  Inc.  did not ensure or verify that at the time of Employee #1's fall he was  using or required to use approved fall protection. This violation of CCR Title  8 Section 1670(a) was determined to be the cause of the fall. Cal/OSHA issued  a Serious Accident Related citation to the Secondary Employer  T & T  Improvements  and a General citation to the Primary Employer  Barrett Business  Services (the latter citation due to lack of evidence of employer knowledge)  according to CCR Title 8 Section 1670(a).",

A large  flatbed truck had arrived at the site with crates carrying 14 sheets of  heavy-duty reinforced glass. Each sheet measured 4 ft by 8 ft  was  0.5625-in.-thick  and weighed about 350 lbs. Normally  the sheets in their  crates would be unloaded with a forklift. However  the owner of the company  had not been able to rent a forklift  and the delivery driver indicated to the  employer that he needed to leave to continue work. According to the police  report  the co-owner of the company admitted that he and the owner had agreed  to \"loose lite\" the load  that is  unload each sheet individually by hand   using suction discs. This procedure was normally used for smaller sheets that  arrived on inclined racks on a smaller truck. The co-owner (the site  supervisor) admitted to having concerns when he observed the way the load had  been shipped  and admitted that the company had never unloaded glass of that  size by hand from a flatbed. At the time of the inspection  it was observed  that the main shipping crate was posted with a large sign stating \"Do not open  any case and attempt lite by lite unloading.\" The company owner stated in an  interview that he was aware that there is a safety regulation stating that  materials being unloaded must be secured against dangerous displacement. At  the time of the accident  there were two employees up on the flatbed and a  foreman and the supervisor/co-owner standing in the street. Employee #1 cut  the bands holding the front covers of the crates and opened the first crate on  the driver's side of the flatbed to begin to separate the sheets. A safety  line consisting of a single nylon rope had been tied mid-way down one of the  vertical supports of the crate holder. Before this rope was anchored  the  upright sheets began to tip over. According to witness statements  Employee #1  attempted to jump in front of the sheets to keep them from falling. He was  knocked off the flatbed by the weight of the falling sheets and at least five  sheets fell and crushed him on the street  a distance of 4.6 ft. below the  flatbed. He was killed.",

Employee #1 used a scissor lift to  elevate himself to the location of the metal framing and hardware attachments   which was at an approximate height of 10 ft above the floor level. The three  overhead doors were removed earlier in the day or on the day before. Using a  wrench  he removed the framing and hardware from one of the three door  openings without any problem. He then started to disassemble the hardware from  the second door opening by removing the nuts and bolt on one end of the metal  railing with the coiled spring inside. This railing spanned the width of the  door opening. He then loosened the nuts and bolts along the middle section of  the railing when the railing sprang off the wall with pressure. The railing  struck him on his left side and pushed him backward and down into the scissor  lift. He was wearing gloves and failed to realize that his left hand was  severely injured. Someone lowered the scissor lift because he was stunned and  could not respond. The metal plate at the end of the railing hit his left  hand. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported  him to a medical center. He fractured his pinky and ring fingers  and  lacerated the left side of his abdomen.

The building was undergoing extensive exterior  restoration due to water damage  including removing the masonry facade and  cleaning the rusted steel beam using pneumatic hammers and needle guns. Two  gasoline powered air compressors (Rolair Systems with Honda engines  Model  #8422HK30) had been placed on the third floor roof of the building. Each  compressor had a 1.5-gallon gas tank and a 9-gallon air tank. In addition   each compressor had a 7.5-gallon auxiliary air tank. The compressors were  usually refueled twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Gasoline was kept in a 5-gallon type-I flammable liquid can equipped with a  plastic funnel. The employer had recently purchased a different brand of  flammable liquid can (Justrite) whose attached funnel was designed so that it  could be bent and take less space during storage/transportation. That feature  made the funnel susceptible to leakage when pouring the liquid. Employee #1  was refueling one of the compressors. The employer's procedure for refueling  the air compressors  as well as other gas powered equipment  was to ensure the  engine was off. According to the employer's subsequent statement  as Employee  #1 refueled the compressor  the gasoline leaked from the two sides of the  attached funnel onto the hot muffler of the compressor and ignited. Coworkers  #1 and #2  who were on the swing stage  suddenly lost air pressure on their  needle guns and saw that the compressors were on fire. They grabbed their fire  extinguisher and assisted Employee #1 to extinguish the fire. The fire was  extinguished by the time the Fire Department arrived. Employee #1 was  transported to a hospital  where he was treated for a first degree burn on his  right forearm  burns to the face  and smoke inhalation. He was then released.  The cause of the accident was spilling of gasoline onto the hot muffler.  Cal/OSHA regulation T8 CCR 5451(e) requires employers to take precautions  against liquid spillage and sources of ignition when transferring flammable  and combustible liquid from one container into another. Although T8 CCR  5451(p) also requires bonding and grounding of containers during such  transfer  static electricity probably was not a major contributing factor in  this fire incident.",

Employee #1 was  working as a carpenter who was assembling and disassembling cement forms used  in the construction of columns and other cement objects. Employee #1 stated  that prior to climbing on to the EZ Commercial Tower Scaffold  he checked and  found a green tag with an authorization signature dated September 4  2012  indicating the work platform had been inspected and access was permitted under  Balfour-Beatty's safety program. At the time of the incident Employee #1 was  standing on scaffold planking at column number seven in building number four   stripping formwork from a cast in place column. Employee #1 reported to have  been using a fifty-six inch long \"Burk\" pry bar to pry off a two-inch by  four-inch wood ledger from cement column number seven that it was attached to.  Employee # 1 was standing on two scaffold planks that were part of an EZ  Commercial Tower Scaffold owned by New Dimension Masonry Inc. The scaffold  planks were supported by a bearer bar that was positioned approximately  two-inches from column number seven  the scaffold planks overlapped the bearer  bar by approximately two inches. A coworker stated that he was working above  Employee #1  on Column number seven. The coworker stated that he saw Employee  #1 make a quick motion with the Burk Bar to pry the wood ledger off the column  and at the same time he saw the two scaffold planks that Employee #1 was  standing on slide right out from under Employee #1's feet. The coworker saw  Employee #1 fall. Employee #1 struck a pipe that was sticking out of the wall  while falling approximately twenty-nine feet to the cement floor below. The  coworker yelled that Employee #1 fell and for someone to call 911.while he  went to Employee #1's aid. A review of the EZ Scaffold Commercial Tower  Scaffold safety and installation manual found on page forty  section B   labeled \"Construction\" that the manufacturer stated that  \"All scaffold planks  must extend six inches beyond and no more than twelve inches past the bearer  bar and that all overhead scaffold planks must overlap a minimum of six  inches. Additional review of the instruction manual found no directions   instructions or authorizations allowing for a deviation of the six-inch  overlap requirement for scaffold planks. A New Dimension Masonry employee  stated that a representative of Balfour Beatty requested the tower scaffold be  left in place for use by other trades after New Dimension Masonry was done  with its use and was ready to disassemble it. Balfour Beatty's Site specific  Safety Program required that a qualified person inspect the scaffold on a  daily basis. When the scaffold was found safe  the qualified person was to  sign and date a green tag indicating the scaffold was safe to use. Employees  of New Dimension Masonry were the competent persons who conducted the daily  safety inspections of the scaffold and would sign/date a green tag indicating  the scaffold was safe to use. Employee #1 and the coworker stated that a green  tag with the current date was in place at the scaffold stairwell on the day of  the incident. Balfour Beatty's employees conducted daily safety inspections of  the work site. Employee #1 fell approximately twenty-nine feet from scaffold  to the floor below. Emergency Medical Service responded and transported  Employee #1 to Scripps La Jolla where he was hospitalized for unspecified  fracture injuries in excess of twenty-four hours.",

        "summary": "On February 26  2007  a subcontractor and his two employees were installing a  steel I-beam  and steel columns  in the middle of a building and running the  length of the building. The building was a one-story  35-ft wide  165-ft long  wood post building. Three forklifts and operators working for the company that  owned the building were assisting in the erection of the steel. They bolted  two 26-ft 7-in. long  by 13.75-in.  by 5-in. I-beams together. Two of the  forklifts elevated the beam to where it was to be installed. As they held the  beam in place  the subcontractor employees positioned and erected three 16-ft  long  6-in. by 6-in. columns vertically (one at a time). This was done  manually. As they held the columns in place their employer bolted the beam to  the columns. The subcontract employer did this while standing on a pallet on  the forks of the third fork lift. One of the two forklifts used to elevate the  steel was inadequate. It did not have enough reach to elevate the beam to the  16-ft high area. The operator had hoisted the beam on the back-rail rather  than on the forks. After the third column was bolted to the beam  the other  forklift left its position. The operator was going after some bracing. The  steel was now being held in position only by the one forklift that had the  beam resting on its back-rail. The concrete foundations for the columns had  not been poured and no anchor pins or leveling devices had been installed. The  beam slipped off the back-rail of the forklift and fell over onto the concrete  floor. The beam struck and crushed Employee #1  an employee of the  subcontractor. Employee #1 was killed.",

In the rear of the cabinet were three stubbed-off  conduits  each with its own string. Employee #1 secured a piece of cardboard  over energized parts of the cabinet that were located just above the crawl  space where the conduits were located. Employee #1  who was not wearing  gloves  lay down and extended his left hand into the cabinet. He grabbed three  strings and waited for his coworker to tug on the string at his (the  coworker's) work location. The necessary conduit was identified. As Employee  #1 withdrew his hand  it came into contact with energized parts. His coworker  sensed a problem and returned to the cabinet. He found Employee #1 stuck to  the cabinet. After deenergizing the system  he began administering first aid.  Emergency personnel from Rancho Cordova responded and arranged transportation  to the UC Davis Medical Center burn center in Sacramento. Several days after  Employee #1 was admitted  doctors amputated three fingers and part of his left  hand. After three months in the hospital  he was finally released.",

The employer  a licensed contractor  was working for the  property's owner. On this day  they were installing a 4-inch riser from the  sidewalk  to be connected into the building's fire sprinkler system. Employee  #2  the contractor's foreman  was at the site working with Employee #1.  Employee #1 was in a pit that was approximately 24 inches by 24 inches by 36  inches deep. Employee #1 was soldering. He was positioned approximately 1 foot  away from Pacific Gas & Electric's (PG & E) underground flexible plastic high  pressure gas line. A fire flared. Employee #1 ran out of the pit. The fire had  burned his face and nose. Emergency services were called. Employee #1 was  taken to St. Francis Hospital  where he stayed approximately 1 week in the  burn unit. Before it was extinguished  this fire burned three adjacent  buildings. The incident was reported to the Cal/OSHA Division by the San  Francisco Fire Department on June 12  2012. A Cal/OSHA Engineer conducted an  investigation at the construction jobsite on June 13  2012. Employee #1   Employee #2 (the foreman)  the general contractor (Employee #1's employer)   and neighboring businesses were interviewed during the course of the  investigation.

        "summary": "Employee #1 along with his foreman was in the process of landing a piece of  tower structure to be added to the top of this communications tower  standing  approximately 200 to 300 feet above ground level. While the two men were in  the process of moving the section into position to be bolted into place  the  hoist operator set the dogs on the hoist to hold the load in place while he  dealt with a distraction that had just come up. Just after the hoist dogs had  been set  and as the hoist operator was dealing with the distraction  the  hoist line slipped. The hoist operator was close enough to the hoist to apply  the hoist brake  thereby catching the structure before it fell to the ground.  The sudden impact of the load on the hoist line caused the gin pole attachment  mounted on the side tower near the top of the structure to break lose from the  tower  while at the same time the tower section on the end of the hoist line  swung into the side of the tower  causing the tower to tremble. At this time   Employee #1 starts coming out of the tower  supposedly thinking the tower was  about to come down. While coming down out of the tower  Employee #1 falls off  the tower some 200 plus feet to the ground. The job foreman also comes off the  tower with no problem or injury. Both men were wearing the required fall  protection equipment and were experienced tower erectors. The hoist operator  was both the president of the company as well as the hoist operator  with  several years experience in both hoist operation as well as tower erection.  The hoist operator acknowledged that he had inspected  or at least looked over  the hoisting equipment prior to his using the equipment. The owner of the  hoist provided literature illustrating that the hoist had just been overhauled  immediately prior to being brought to and used on this job. The hoisting  equipment  including both the hoist and the gin pole  were already attached to  the tower when this company arrived on site to replace a previous erection  company who was removed from the job by the owner of the tower. The  distraction listed above was caused by the previous company arriving on the  job site only to see the Diamond C Company working on this tower. They were  using the hoisting equipment without their knowledge of the change made by the  tower owner and general contractor of the tower construction. It was concluded  that the accident was caused by the hoist operator using the hoist brake to  arrest the fall of the tower section  which caused the gin pole to break lose  from the tower and the structure on the end of the hoist line to swing into  the tower  sending strong vibrations throughout the tower  causing Employee #1  to think that the tower was about to come down. This tower was still standing  several days after the accident as well as at the time the CSHO returned to  the job site to finish the onsite investigation a day or so after the  accident.",

This resulted  in serious burns to his wrist and hand. The employer was a roofing contractor  with approximately 13 years of experience and with eight employees on the  job-site. Employee #1 was not a manager or supervisor and was working within  his trade and at the task assigned to him.",

Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall.

A Cal/OSHA regulation required  employees to be instructed in the safe use of the work platform  and Employee  #1 was not instructed before operating the scissor lift for the first time.  The violation was classified as \"general\" because the Division could not  establish substantial probability. The employer was also cited for not  notifying the Division about the incident. Other violations were observed  and  the employer was cited accordingly. The Division ordered the scissor lift to  be preserved on the day of the inspection. A forensics company was contracted  by Employee #1's attorney to evaluate the lift. During the examination  the  scissor lift had not demonstrated any unintended movement.

Employee #1  along with three other coworkers  had  been hired that morning from an informal labor pool located in Culver City.  There were four workers  including Employee #1  and one foreman at the site at  the time of inspection. The foreman was the property owner's gardener  who had  hired the employees out of the informal labor pool at the property owner's  request. Three of the workers were engaged in landscaping work  and Employee  #1 was on a scaffold applying a color coat of stucco to the residence. The  scaffold on site was comprised of parts from a rolling scaffold and had been  field modified to fit the topography of the work area. The scaffold legs were  precariously leveled on small wood shims that were stacked on standard  concrete blocks. The working level Employee #1 was working on was one 20-inch  wide BilJax manufactured plank that had been placed on the top rail of the  scaffold. The plank was found to be missing one of the attachment hooks  and  as a result  it was only supported from three attachment points spanning the  top rail of the scaffold. At the time of the accident  one of the other  workers on the site handed Employee # a cellphone  and when Employee #1  reached for the cellphone  the plank shifted and threw Employee #1 forward and  ejected him from the scaffold. The worker fell 10 feet  6 inches to the  concrete walkway and suffered multiple fractures of his skull  a neck fracture  and a severed superior sagittal sinus vein. Paramedics transported him to  Cedars Sinai hospital  where he died at 1:39 p.m. while in surgery.",

The PCI crew was  preparing the reactors for service and the work was scheduled to be completed  the day before  on May 21  2011. The crew working on the reactors was doing so  with a confined space permit. The confined space permit utilized by the PCI  crew for the uncompleted reactor was returned  however the permit was not  filled out properly. It did not indicate that the reactor would require  further work on following day  and it did not indicate that employees would be  entering the confined space the following day. On the morning of May 22  2011   the PCI crew returned to work and was working primarily on a different  reactor. Employee #1  one of the PCI crew supervisors  realized that he needed  a specific allen wrench to perform work  which had been left inside the  confined space reactor that had been serviced but not completed the day  before. Employee #1 returned to the reactor and an attendant went with him.  Employee #1 did not meter the atmosphere  nor did he verify that it had been  metered. Employee #1 entered the confined space  obtained the wrench  and  handed it to the attendant. Employee #1 became weakened and fell down the  entry ladder into the reactor. Employee #1 was killed. Employee #1 was  carrying the radio  and the attendant did not have a radio with him  so he  began to shout for help. After several minutes  two insulators approached the  attendant. The insulators radioed to a different host employer's operations  crew in a different unit  who alerted the host employer's operations crew in  the unit where the incident was occurring. Employee #2  a host employer  operator  responded. Employee #2 entered the confined space to aid Employee  #1. Employee #2 passed out and was killed. Additional operations crew  responded with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) but they had trouble  entering the manway due to the limited span of the manway which would not  allow the passage of a responder with air bottles on their back. The  responders had to enter the space and have the air bottle handed down. The  crew could not lift the dead employees up through the upper manway and had to  open a bottom manway which dumped the catalyst out of the reactor along with  Employee #2. Employee #1 was lowered down through the bottom manway.",

It had been reported that the N-5 unit was shut down  but it later  was found that the 2nd stage was recirculating while waiting for crude ACH  from the N-3 unit. The 100% HCN tank  next to which the F/D employees had been  working  had been washed 11 times since the Thursday before the incident. At  about 1:50 p.m.  a F/D pipefitter read 13 ppm on his personal monitox (cyanide  monitor)  so he went to the control room  where an operator checked the area  with a Drager HCN detector tube. Hydrogen cyanide was not detected and another  monitox was given to the pipefitter. Employees were told that they could  continue working. At about this time a pipefitter helper began feeling dizzy.  About 20 minutes later  the 2nd monitox indicated 161 ppm cyanide  and the  pipefitter took it back to the control room while the other F/D employees left  the area. At this point  the pipefitter began feeling very ill  coughing up  blood and experiencing difficulty breathing. Rohm and Haas used detector tubes  to check the area again for HCN  but it was not detected. The alarm was never  sounded because detector tubes and the perimeter monitoring system indicated  non-detection during the incident. The pipefitter was showered in the  emergency shower and taken by ambulance to Southmore Hospital. His coworkers  then went to the change house for showers. There  two of the coworkers became  ill. Later  other F/D employees became ill. Belmont Construction Services  employees had been working primarily in the KP area  which was shut down so  there was no methyl methacrylate present. By 6:00 p.m. some of their employees  had become ill and passed out; some of them became ill on the bus that took  them from the Belmont area to the contractors' gate. Fifteen Belmont employees  were taken to the hospital and 13 stayed overnight for observation. In  addition  one Rohm and Haas employee and one Laidlaw employee  who had been  working in the West Waste Treatment Plant  were hospitalized. Overall  34  employees from the four different companies were affected. Medical tests for  Belmont  Laidlaw  F/D  and Rohm and Haas employees all returned normal. The  employees who left the plant site and were taken directly to the hospital were  reportedly tested for cyanide in the blood within 20 minutes of the onset of  known symptoms. Later tests could not substantiate a cyanide exposure  but  some employees' doctors stated that the employees had been exposed. The  weather that day consisted of heavy rain and 100% humidity. The monitoxes were  sent to the manufacturer  who said that water was inside them and that they  could not find traces of HCN on the monitoxes. An outside operator stated that  she had had her monitox fail high after getting it wet or dropping it. The  manufacturer's operating manual specifies operating limits of 20 to 95%  relative humidity. The Drager detector tubes also have a relative humidity  range of less than 80%.

The initial blow of the continuous ram diesel  pile-driving hammer drove the pile 2 to 3 feet into the ground. This caused  the wire rope cable (whip-line) to peel rapidly off the crane drum and wrap  around the outside of the drum. The whip-line  also referred to as the power  line  is choked around the piling and is used to hoist the pile into the lead  and to steady the pile while it is being driven. As the crew tried to free the  cable  they continued to hammer the piling  assuming that the whip-line cable  would unravel if the piling were forced lower into the ground. Instead  this  action placed tension on the crane boom  pulling it down toward the lead. When  the job foreman realized this  he attempted unsuccessfully to hammer at the  whip-line and knock it up the piling. When all methods failed to unravel the  line  the foreman instructed Employee #1 to climb on top of a shed adjacent to  the lead and to cut/burn the shackle on the whip-line. Employee #1 climbed the  lead ladder  was handed the cutting torch  and began to cut/burn the whip-line  itself  which was not what he had been instructed to do.

        "summary": "On June 25  2006  Employee #1 was part of a crew that was removing antenna  equipment from a 1 900-ft communication tower for placement on another tower.  One of the workers was on the ground operating the Hydraulic Power Systems   Inc.  hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on  the tower  removing the equipment. Once it was free  they would connect it to  a 5/8-in. nylon rope  and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600  ft level of the tower  where Employee #1 was located. He was connected to and  suspended by a 1/2 in. wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him   he would connect it to the hoist line  and the hoist operator would then lower  him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the  equipment  and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the  course of the operations  Employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope  broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from  approximately 1 800 ft  as did a headache ball that was also attached to the  rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was  on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop  and the  shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball.  The nylon rope  headache ball  and equipment fell until they struck Employee  #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a CM chain repair link  that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning  system. The link separated and Employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He  was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the  hoisting system: the rigging  hoist line  and slings that were used to raise  personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; Employee #1 was on  the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit;  Employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle  above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on  the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel  hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope  where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at  approximately 500 ft on the tower.",

        "summary": "On February 13  2012  an employee was standing in a wooden crate while lifting  a rubber hose  full of grout material  to an elevated position on a nearby  scaffold. The wooden crate was elevated by placing the wooden crate on the  forks of a rented forklift. The wooden crate was not secured to the forks of  the rented forklift. The hose was being manually carried by the employee while  he stood in the wooden crate. The employee's position on the elevated wooden  crate  in addition to the weight of the rubber hose full of grout  caused the  elevated wooden crate to become unstable. This condition resulted in the  employee falling off the crate and onto the ground below him. The employee's  face impacted the surface on the ground. The wooden crate hit the ground near  the employee and it tumbled onto the employee. The crate ended up resting on  top of the lower half of the injured employee's body. The distance of the fall  was 7 feet 6 inches. The height of the guard rail on the wooden crate that was  used to elevate the injured employee was found to be 32 inches. The employee  was taken to the hospital for emergency care. The employee died shortly after  his arrival at the hospital. Due to the circumstances associated with this  incident  the Division issued an accident related serious citation related to  failure of the immediate employer to ensure that the wooden crate was secured  to the forks of the forklift  in such a manner as to prevent the wooden crate  from tipping over. Another accident related citation was issued concerning the  height of the guard rail on the wooden crate. The height of the guard rail was  measured to be 32 inches. The regulations required that the height of the  guard rail on the wooden crate should have been 42 inches.",

A tower crane was making the first concrete bucket pick of the morning.  The crane operator was using visual hand signals from signalmen both at the  street level and lower deck level. The street level signalman signaled the  crane operator that the load was ready for lift. His duties were to observe  the concrete bucket until it was raised approximately 20 ft  then the load  became the crane operator's responsibility until the bucket nears the deck  level  at which time the deck signalman would guide the crane operator to the  pour location. A fully loaded 3 yard concrete bucket weighed approximately  14 000 lbs. Immediately after the concrete bucket cleared the street  the  street level signalman went around to the side of the concrete truck to sign  the driver's paperwork. The crane operator was trawling the loaded concrete  bucket towards the excavation when the bucket struck the top of a scaffold  that was located immediately adjacent to the concrete loading area.

Manufactured sand was being used to backfill the excavated area around a  concrete pump vault that had been constructed inside the shoring. A two-tier  wale system had been installed inside the perimeter of the shoring walls with  the lower tier being W27x102 I-beams  while the upper tier consisted of W21x55  I-beams. Numerous approximately 6 ft long steel vertical members had been  bolted up between the two wale levels. The wale system was suspended in place  in the four corners via wire rope fed through holes in the sheet piles  looped  under the top wale and tied back to itself. The wire rope loops were  constructed with .815 in. 6x25 EIP IW RREG wire rope utilizing a parallel lap  splice. Only two wire rope clips were in place at each splice  one for each  dead end. As part of the backfilling/shoring removal operations  the lower  section of wales and vertical members had been dismantled with the vertical  members and three of the four lower wales having been removed from the area.  The lower east wale was unable to be removed from the shored area due to space  constraints and had been chained up to the upper wale. At the time of the  accident  Employee #1 was operating a vibratory compactor  while working under  the east double wales. Employee #2 was working under the north wale. Employee  #3 was standing on top of the pump vault directing Employee #4 who was  operating a LinkBelt 3400 backhoe  sprinkling the manufactured sand in a gap  between the east wales and the nearby vault. The lap splice in the northeast  wire rope loop assembly failed  dropping the north and east portion of the  wale system onto Employees #1 and #2. The remainder of the wales remained  elevated. Pertaining to the wire rope clips on the three remaining job-made  wire rope loops  each splice was noted to have one saddle of the clip on one  dead end of the rope and one u-bolt portion on the other dead end of the  ropes. Employee #2 was struck in the head by the dropping north wale and was  knocked to the ground. Employee #2 was not hospitalized. Employee #1 was  struck by and pinned under the east wales with fatal injuries. The east double  wales  including the manufactured sand placed on them  were estimated to weigh  approximately 9 300 lbs. The north wale weighed approximately 1300 lbs.

This was  one of 12 buildings  each consisting of four separate residential units  for a  total of 48 units. The project involved blowing cellulose insulation through  the building attics  using an insulation blower machine. Employee #1 had  completed three units and  on the day of the incident  had returned to begin  work on other units. Employee #1 used an 8-foot A-frame step ladder in the  closed position to access the roof of an 8-foot high building to install  insulation through the attic. The top of the ladder extended only to the  midpoint of the roof eaves. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 both used the ladder  to ascend to the roof and descend from the roof multiple times by stepping  onto the top cap of the ladder. Then Employee #1 stepped onto the top cap of  the ladder once again as he attempted to descend from the roof level. The  footing of the ladder slipped as he positioned his feet on the second rung  from the top cap. Employee #1 fell approximately 7 feet to ground level.  Employee #1 was transported to Desert Regional Medical Center by ambulance. He  was admitted for rib fractures  multiple internal injuries  and a sprained  wrist. According to medical records  after receiving treatment for his  injuries  Employee #1 was discharged from hospital on June 26  2012. Employee  #1 had been employed by the contractor as an Insulation Installer for  approximately 6 days when the incident occurred. Because the employer had left  the site earlier that day to attend another project and Coworker #1 was away  from the site taking a lunch break  there were no direct witnesses to the  incident.",

A rubber tired  Grove RT 745 Crane was being used to  assist in the rigging process. A lifting mechanism that consisted of a choker   shackle  ropes and a cotter pin was being used. Based on the task at hand  the  ground man would have attached the hinge pin through the shackle and then  through the column splice lug hole and back through the other side of the  shackle hole. A cotter pin would then be placed through the end tip of the  hinge pin. A nylon rope would also be attached to the handle side of the hinge  pin. Another nylon rope would be connected to the cotter pin so that when the  steel column was erected  the rope would be pulled  the cotter pin would fall  out and then the rope connected to the hinge pin would be pulled and that  portion of the rigging apparatus would fall to the ground. The investigation  revealed that during the initial set up  the cotter pin was placed down side  up; so if the rope is pulled  the pin would not pop out. The coworker signaled  the crane operator to begin the lift. As the column was being raised  the  ground man noticed the inverted cotter pin and motioned the crane operator to  stop. At that time  the ground man adjusted the cotter pin and motioned the  crane operator to continue the lift. The rigging connection released from the  column shortly after the column was hoisted to about a 45 degree angle. The  mechanism had been placed under and not through the splice lug hole. The  employee was killed when a 44.2 foot steel column  weighing about 2 300 lbs  fell on him. The coworker stated that he did not notice that the rigging  connection was not connected through the splice lug hole on the steel column.

He was operating a scissor lift  a Skyjack SJ111-3219  Equipment No.  103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical  wires. After positioning the lift  he raised the lift's platform to reach the  conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left  conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit  he needed to  move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the  other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he  reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand  to move the  lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to  the right. However  the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the  toggle switch was on \"lift\" mode instead of a \"drive\" mode. He immediately  released the controller and tried to move the platform down  but it continued  to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and  an overhead pipe. Eventually  Employee #1 was able to bring the platform down.  Emergency services were called  and the San Mateo Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three  days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Mateo Fire Department and  the Employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  respectively  on July  18  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation at the work site at  approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 30  2013. Participating in the inspection  were Employee #1's foreman/supervisor  the project superintendent of the  general contractor  and the field operations manager of the general  contractor. The investigation revealed that Employee #1's employer had leased  the scissor lift from Sunstate Equipment since October 16  2012. The employer  returned the scissor lift to Sunstate Equipment on July 19  2013  the day  after Employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's  possession  the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering  problem  and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability  to go up. Cal/OSHA did not issue an Accident-Related citation  because the  investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of Title 8   California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR). However  Cal/OSHA issued one General  Citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the  proper use of Skyjack III 3219 Scissor Lift  in accordance with the  manufacturer's operating instructions  and Section 3203  Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  Section 3638(d).",

The San Francisco Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA   which began its investigation August 22  2013. The investigator determined  that Employee #1 had more than 27 years of carpentry experience and was  knowledgeable in the use and hazards of table saws. During the interview   Employee #1 asserted that he had not removed the blade guard (hood assembly).  He did acknowledge that he was not using a push stick  because he did not  think it was necessary. The investigation report stated that if the guard was  not removed  the primary cause of this accident was the failure to use a push  stick. Because the employee was working alone  and the employer was not  present  the employer's knowledge could not be established. Therefore  no  serious accident-related violation was issued.

        "summary": "At approximately 3:30 p.m. on May 15  2013  Employee #1  a roofer employed by  Cal-Pac Roofing  was engaged in roofing activity at an existing single-story  residential house in South San Francisco  CA. He was working with his helper   Coworker #1. They were installing membrane vapor barrier on the roof. Employee  #1 fell off the roof and landed on a concrete floor approximately 8 feet  below. The homeowner came out of the house and placed a call for emergency  assistance. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital.  After two days of observation at the hospital  he was admitted. Employee #1  was treated for a fractured arm and a concussion. The employer reported this  event at approximately 4:12 p.m. on May 17  2013  within the required time  frame  to Cal/OSHA's San Mateo District Office. The subsequent investigation  began on May 23  2013. It included interviews and review of documents.  However  despite multiple attempts to interview Employee #1  he did not  cooperate. Coworker #1 also was unavailable for interview. The employer stated  that Coworker #2  a foreman/supervisor who was out of state at the time of the  fall  responded and went to the jobsite. Coworker #2 was interviewed during  the investigation. Coworker #2 stated that he interviewed Coworker #1 after  Employee #1's fall. He stated that Coworker #1 told him that both Employee #1  and Coworker #2 were installing membrane on the roof and were far away from  the roof's edge when Coworker #2 suddenly realized that Employee #1 had  vanished off the roof. Coworker #2 said he did not know the cause of the fall.  The investigation further determined that the pitch of the roof was  approximately 4:12  the roof was approximately 8 feet high  and the work  activity was not a new construction. Under T8 CCR 1730  roofers are exempt  from having fall protection if working at a height of less than 20 feet with  some conditions. At the time of the investigation report  due to lack of  Employee #1's cooperation  Cal/OSHA was unable to conclude whether the  conditions of T8 1730 were violated by the Employer. Therefore  there was no  plan to issue a citation.",

        "title": "Employee Is Burned When Hot Water Line Bursts",
        "summary": "At approximately 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday  June 19  2013  Employee #1 was one of  several workers installing a new sewer line for the city of Redwood City  CA.  The line was approximately 400 feet (122 meters) long and six inches (150  millimeters) in diameter. The workers were in the middle of a street. The  sewer pipe line was approximately 4 feet (1.2 meters) underground and ran  diagonally beneath the middle of Oakwood Street. Workers were using the  \"cured-in-place\" technique at this work site. This technique required that a  tube membrane material be inserted from a manhole and through the sewer and  then retrieved through the next manhole. The first step the workers performed  after preparing the materials was inversion; this process pushed the tube  membrane from one end of the sewer line to the other end through the  bombardment of cool water. The workers installed Enviroliners membrane  material securely in place within the sewer line from one manhole to the next  with cool water  flushing it for approximately one hour. Immediately  afterward  they began to flush it with hot water at a temperature of up to 150  degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) at 5 pounds psi (34.5 kPa). The hot  water reacted with the polyester  vinyl-ester and epoxy resin in the membrane.  Hot water bombardment would take approximately up to three hours for the  chemical composition to react and to harden this membrane into a hard and  durable pipe material in order to maintain a constant wall thickness of a  pipe. It was done to create a durable  continuous  and smooth interior to  promote and improve strength of the 6-inch 150-millimeter) diameter sewer line  pipe. While flushing the membrane with hot water from a steam truck  Employee  #1 was adjusting the temperature controls from a truck that was right beside  the manhole. The narrative did not specify whether the controls were on a  second truck. The connection went from the hot water steam truck hose through  a manifold  using a sleeve connector  to the membrane  and then on to the  sewer line. At approximately 6:00 p.m.  the membrane area near the manifold  and sleeve connector burst open  and a few cups of hot water squirted out and  onto Employee #1  who was standing nearby. He sustained third-degree burns to  his left elbow  forearm  and left lower back. He cried out in pain and fell to  the ground. His foreman  who was nearby  saw what had happened and immediately  turned off the water flow from the steam truck. Employee #1 was taken to a  Kaiser-Permanente facility in Redwood City and then to St. Francis Hospital   where he received treatment for his injuries. Employee #1 was hospitalized  over 24 hours. The employer reported the incident to the Division the next  day. The Division opened an inspection fourteen days later  on July 3  2013.  At the time of this inspection  the foreman and other employees stated that  what had transpired was a typical day on the job except for the membrane's  bursting  which had never happened before. The foreman stated that the  membrane's bursting at low pressure was an anomaly and probably due to a  factory defect. The foreman stated that the membrane burst at its seams   because it was defective. At the time of the inspection  the membrane that had  burst had already been thrown away. No accident-related violation was issued.",

        "summary": "At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 11  2013  Employee #1  a carpenter  foreman employed by Pacific Peninsula Group  was performing interior carpentry  at a residential construction site. He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted  benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing  modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated  wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4  inches high  his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were  severely cut. Emergency services were called  and the Mountain View Fire  Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  where  he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger  which had been completely  severed past the first knuckle near the palm  was surgically reattached. The  left ring finger  which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle   also was reattached  but during a return hospital visit this finger required  surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the  employer  and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its  subsequent investigation  Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction  management company performing as a general contractor for this residential  apartment building project  with tasks being performed by its own employees as  well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip  cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished  piece  because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches  high. Employee #1 was working alone  and no witness to the event was  identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood  a splitter  and an  anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the  site  but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the  time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip  fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other  anti-kickback attachments  separate from the guard/hood  available to install.  He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made  cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and  guiding the wood through the blade  with his right hand positioned at the end  of the wood length nearest to him  and his left hand positioned on the top and  at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push  block or push stick at the saw  and he did not make one to use. He stated that  the first cut was almost complete  and the blade was about to come out at the  back side of the wood piece  when the wood kicked back and shot past his right  side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade  before the cut  but was pulled back partially by the kick-back  or his hand  movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted  the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard   anti-kickback  and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable.  They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not  have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut  of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the  blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that  the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the  blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices  such as  featherboards  were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been  installed. No protective devices  such as featherboards or anti-kickback  attachments  were available or installed on the table saw during the time when  the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were  available during the time when the table saw was being used.",

Employee #1's employer was subcontracted to  Segue Construction  Inc.  the general contractor  to install underground  plumbing and related plumbing trenches. The employer's workers had excavated a  relatively shallow sewer trench  approximately 2 feet 6 inches deep. They then  set the pipe in the trench. Their work progressed toward one end of the site   while another contractor followed behind to excavate a deeper trench and  install in it the electrical utility. Employee #1 was instructed by Coworker  #1  a manager  to drop back to areas where the sewer pipe had been recently  installed and to tape plastic sleeving for corrosion protection to the 4-inch  sanitary sewer riser. Due to the configuration of site utilities  there were  several locations where the sewer and electrical trenches crossed. One of  these locations was Grid Line 8  between Grid Lines M and N  where the  electrical trench had been excavated crosswise to the sewer trench and  approximately 3 feet from the sewer riser. The work was scheduled so that the  excavation activities of the two trades were not physically conflicting.  Employee #1 worked safely within the sewer trench  installing the plastic  sleeving. He then exited the shallow trench to retrieve more tape. He climbed  out of the sewer trench at the corner where it intersected with the deeper  electrical trench. The corner broke off  and Employee #1 fell into the deeper  electrical trench  a fall height of 7 feet. Although Employee #1 climbed out  of the trench on his own  he was gasping for breath. Coworker #2 came over and  evaluated Employee #1. Coworker #1 called for an ambulance after Employee #1  lost consciousness. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department responded and  transported Employee #1 to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated for  bruising to the neck. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer at  approximately 3:00 p.m. on December 3  2013. It also was reported by the  general contractor and the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department. During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Diablo Plumbing  was a plumbing contractor that performed work on a wide range of both  residential and commercial projects  including related excavation work. The  investigation report concluded that the employer had failed to reevaluate the  trench conditions when the situation changed. The top edges and corners of the  trench were beveled in many places from drying and cracking and/or minor  sloughing. Where the newer  deeper electrical conduit trench was excavated at  right angles to the sewer trench  the drying reentrant corners where the  trenches met constituted a new hazard to Employee #1  who was working in one  of these areas. The employer had failed to train Employee #1 to recognize and  avoid this new hazard. The investigation found that Employee #1 could have  avoided the new hazard if he had walked further away from the deeper  electrical utility trench before exiting the shallower sewer trench.",

The employer notified Cal/OSHA of this event at 9:00 a.m. on  September 11  2013. The investigation determined the employer was engaged in  Southern California utility trench  pothole  and public works asphalt paving  restoration. Employee #1 had been regularly employed by the employer for four  months as a skid steer operator/laborer. Employee #1 had worked for several  years previously. The investigation determined that the cause of the injury  was the employer's failure to ensure that the employee follow the  manufacturer's recommendations with regard to mounting and dismounting the  vehicle and not facing the skid steer while stepping out of it.",

Employee #1 was working  from an aluminum extension ladder at the south end of the west wall and  scraping paint from the wall while Coworker #1 held the ladder steady.  Employee #1 climbed to the seventh step of the ladder  approximately 80 inches  from the floor. Coworker #1 received a telephone call from Coworker #2  requesting that he open the alley vehicle door. Coworker #1 asked Employee #1  if he needed to come down from the ladder while Coworker #1 moved away to open  the door. Employee #1 said the ladder was steady and he would continue  working. Coworker #1 moved away from his position holding the ladder steady  and opened the alley door to allow Coworker #2 to drive into the building.  Coworker #1 then closed the door and began to walk back to Employee #1's  location. Before Coworker #1 reached the ladder  the ladder slipped  and  Employee #1 fell to the floor. Emergency personnel were called  and the Santa  Monica Fire Department responded and transported Employee #1 to UCLA Westwood  Medical Center. Employee #1 was treated in the emergency room for a laceration  to his forehead and a dislocated shoulder. He was released from the emergency  room at 7:00 p.m. on March 8  2013. Because Employee #1 did not sustain a  serious injury  his employer did not have an obligation to notify Cal/OSHA.  However  the Santa Monica Fire Department reported this event to Cal/OSHA at  10:55 a.m. on March 8  2013. At 10:10 a.m. on March 13  2013  Cal/OSHA's Los  Angeles Division began an investigation at the site. Its investigation  determined that the area where the ladder legs were placed and where the fall  occurred was an automotive dealership vehicle service area that had a build-up  of oil and dirt on the floor. The ladder base safety feet were in serviceable  condition  but the slippery floor surface would require that other means be  employed to ensure ladder stability. While the ladder was being held by  Coworker #1  the ladder was secure. When Coworker #1 stopped holding the  ladder  it became unstable and ultimately slipped out from under Employee #1.  The Division planned to issue an accident related serious citation  a general  violation for T8 CCR 3276(e)(7) with lack of employer knowledge and a  non-serious injury.",

In this process  it was  necessary to vertically join together 10 ft long assemblies consisting of  three parts. The innermost part was a metal water pipe with an approximately  20 in. diameter. These assemblies weighed several hundred pounds and were  handled using an overhead hoist operated electrically by an operator with a  direct line of sight to the assembly crew. The stainless steel axle  when  fully assembled is driven by an overhead motor and is used to activate an  impeller that drives water vertically up the water pipe. The 7 in. metal axle  housing protects the axle and weighs approximately 200 lb per 10 ft section.  The outermost water pipe carries water upward to large pumps for  transportation through larger water lines. It has collars welded inside it  just large enough to allow the axle housing to be held firmly in place when  installed. At the time of the accident  the stainless steel axle had been  lowered and connected to the axle section below it. The operator was lowering  the axle housing to be threaded into the coupling on the housing section below  it when the axle housing section became caught on a collar inside the  outermost water pipe. This resulted in some slack in the hoist chain that was  not visible inside the water pipe. Not seeing the next section of the axle  housing  Employee #1 put his hand into the water pipe to locate the axle  housing  thinking it was secured by the hoist. At that instant  the axle  housing slid through the water pipe collar  catching Employee #1's thumb  between the edge of the falling axle housing and the axle housing coupling  below. His thumb was partially amputated and he was transported to the  hospital for treatment.",

The window was kept closed  and no additional ventilation  was provided. The refinishing process typically took two to three hours to  complete. The first step in the process was to strip the old polyurethane  finish from the tub  which took approximately 20 to 30 minutes. A stripping  agent called KLEAN STRIP that contained 80 - 85 percent methylene chloride was  used. A pint of KLEAN STRIP was poured into the tub and spread around the tub  with a brush. It was allowed to react with the old finish  and the loosened  finish was removed from the tub with a scraper. The loosened finish was then  brushed into a dustpan and dumped into a plastic bag. The tub was washed down  with water and a cleanser  dried with paper towels and compressed air  and  sanded to remove burrs. The tub was ready to be masked and sprayed with a new  polyurethane finish. The employee was not wearing respiratory protection. When  the homeowners noticed that there was no noise coming from the bathroom  they  went to the room to discover the employee slumped over the tub. They tried to  administer medical aid and called for emergency services  but the employee was  dead. The cause of death was due to methylene chloride intoxication.",

The shop uses punch presses for forming Toyota truck body parts. The machine  under consideration is a 300-ton capacity press with 12 to 16 strokes per  minute  manufactured by Shimomura Press Manufacturing Company of Japan   machine model number DCLP-300-22E. The punch press is a part revolution  machine with emergency stop pushbuttons installed at five locations including  at both hand pushbutton panels. Pressing one of these buttons causes the slide  to stop immediately. In order to ensure the safety of the operator during the  downward movement of the slide  the machine is designed to require the use of  both hands to press the pushbuttons continuously until the slide reaches the  lower dead point. The machine works two shifts every working day and it makes  about 12 different Toyota truck body parts. At the time of the accident   Employee #1 was working by himself. The employee had been working in this  machine for four years. While changing die for stamping fuel tank upper part  number 7711102100  Employee #1 pressed the two (hand) pushbuttons and the  slide went down. As he released his hands  the slide/die eventually went up.  Employee #1 leaned forward (across) to reach the air ejector valve for making  some adjustments. At that time  the slide came down (for the second time) and  struck his right elbow. This amounted to 'double cycling' without actuating  the hand push buttons. According to Employee #1  this feature happened a few  times in the past. Employee #1 was a regular employee of TABC  Inc. Employee  #1 was hospitalized in the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center where he was  treated for an avulsion fracture of his right elbow  soft tissue loss  and  nerve damage. The investigation determined that no lockout/tag out procedure  was followed while adjusting the air ejector valve (during the die change  procedure).",

He was installing new Edison meters to replace the  legacy meters on an existing electrical panel at an industrial complex. In an  interview  he related the details of the incident. Employee #1 had  successfully installed the first of three meters on a bank of meter switchgear  that was vertically arrayed. The meters were in a three-phase 480-volt system.  At 1:40 p.m.  he had scanned the first meter  using an MBLink mobile handheld  device to record that it was operable. Employee #1 next removed the second  meter and seated its replacement. He was placing the lock ring around that  meter  when he heard a humming sound. He immediately turned away  and an arc  flash occurred. It was the result of a phase-to-phase fault. He was thrown  back by the force of the blast. Because he had turned away upon initially  hearing the humming sound just before the arc flash  he sustained burns to his  ear and cheek. He watched as the electrical system continued to burn and arc.  He used his fire extinguisher to mitigate the ensuing fire before the  Fullerton fire department arrived on the scene. Employee #1 was wearing full  personal protective equipment (PPE) for electrical work: rubber insulated  gloves  leather gloves  long sleeve shirt  face shield  and safety glasses.  The arc flash resulting from the fault caused Employee #1 to sustain second-  and third-degree burn to the right side of his face and ear. He was treated at  an emergency room and released the same day. Employee #1 was a journeyman  electrician with IBEW local 47. He had over 10 years of experience working as  an electrician. He had worked full-time for the company replacing Edison  meters since July 2011. The company had written procedures for replacing the  meters  and they provided documentation of training the employee on those  written procedures. Further  Employee #1 confirmed that he was following those  procedures when the accident occurred. During the course of the worker's  employment  he had installed 35 to 40 new meters per workday without incident.  On the date of the accident  the employee had successfully completed 38  installations  with only two remaining for the day. It is unknown exactly what  caused the fault that resulted in the arc flash. The arc flash may  however   have been attributed to any of the following conditions: 1) the meter was  defective  2) a demand was placed on the load side during installation that  caused a surge  3) the meter was not properly seated into the meter socket  or  4) the employee made contact with the energized components with either a tool  or the meter's lock ring. There were no violations of Title 8  California Code  of Regulations found during the investigation.",

He was then sent  to the Bakersfield  CA  area to gain climbing experience for a towerman  rating. The majority of his work was conducted in the southern San Joaquin  Valley. It involved a crew of two climbers and a groundsman who inspected  towers for housekeeping  footing defects  bent or rusted components  loose  bolts  and guy tensions. The crews used all-terrain vehicles to access remote  towers  which exposed them to a significant amount of dust. In June  2006   after five weeks in this position   Employee #1 developed a cough; in the  sixth week  his supervisor restricted him to groundsman duties. The next  weekend  he was seen by a physician  who diagnosed walking pneumonia and  prescribed medication. Employee #1's condition deteriorated and his cough  progressed enough that his supervisor and coworkers became concerned. On  returning home  Employee #1 went to the hospital  where he was admitted for  pneumonia. He called his lead supervisor on June 23  2006  and left a message  reporting that he was in the hospital. The morning of June 24  the lead  supervisor contacted him to confirm hospitalization and was told that Employee  #1 had been diagnosed with pneumonia. The lead supervisor visited Employee #1  in the hospital on June 26  and subsequently was informed that Employee #1 had  contracted a fungal infection called Valley fever (Coccidioides immitis) while  working in the Bakersfield area. Valley fever is a well-known endemic  environmental health hazard in Kern County with increasing prevalence. The  employer had an effective safety and health program  including hazard  awareness training for Valley fever. In addition  employees received in-depth  annual safety/health training for hazards to which they might be exposed.  Employee #1 had not received this training  although adequate awareness  training was documented in a tailboard meeting. The root cause of Employee  #1's condition was determined to be misdiagnosis by the medical provider and  failure to mitigate the progression of illness. A contributing factor was the  fact that Employee #1 was a new employee without accumulated sick leave or the  capacity to suffer financial hardship.",

The TBM had been excavating in closed mode for  approximately 17 days. Closed mode is a term used to describe one of two modes  of operation this TBM was capable of performing  the other being open mode.  Closed mode excavation involves the pressurization of the cutterhead and face  of the TBM to support the ground and/or control excessive groundwater inflows.  The position of the TBM found it excavating through a large vertical fault  zone that later became the Detachment Fault. The ground conditions required  the TBM face to be pressurized to approximately 13 bars of pressure. The grout  being injected in the annular space was being pumped in at approximately 14  bars. The swing shift had begun work and was preparing to erect a ring segment  set; Ring #135. The swing shift began to build Ring #135 at about 4:00 p.m.  The first segment was successfully installed in the tunnel crown (top of the  tunnel). The crew then began to install the second segment  which was to be  placed in front of the keystone of Ring #134. Three hydraulic rams  including  one abutting the keystone of Ring #134  were slowly retracted. Almost as soon  as the retraction began  a loud pop was heard. Some members of the crew  reported hearing a second pop. The keystone for Ring #134 had shifted forward  approximately 4 inches. The come-a-long did not hold the forces exerted  and  the gears were stripped out. This shift permitted grout and other materials  such as rocks to escape the annulus at a pressure of approximately 14 bars  (200 psi). Employee #1 was standing in front of the area where the gap  developed. He was struck and killed by the moving grout and rocks. Coworkers  found Employee #1 and removed him from the tunnel.",

Employee #1 and Employee #2 of Chula Vista Electric responded to the  site to troubleshoot and repair the equipment causing the electrical outage. A  worker led Employee #1 and #2 to an electrical room  where Employee #1 opened  the 4 160-volt 3-phase OFC switch device. The OFC switching device contains  three separate OFC switches  one switch for each electrical phase. The OFC  device had a mechanical linkage that turns the internal fuses approximately a  .25 turn. The turning of the fuse .25 turn disconnects the fuses from their  contact points within the switch. The fuses are immersed in clear dielectric  oil  which is intended to quench any electrical arc that may occur when the  fuses are connected or disconnected from an energized electrical source. The  three OFC switches are opened and closed simultaneously through the use of the  mechanical linkage. Electrical power was still energized to the incoming  (line) side of the fuse contact point within the OFC switches. Opening the OFC  switch device deenergized the electrical power to the OFC fuses and to a  malfunctioning transformer powered by the OFC switch device. As part of the  troubleshooting process Employee #1 checked the fuses in the OFC switches. One  fuse holder was removed completely and visually inspected. Employee #1 saw  that the fuse was blown and noted that the dielectric oil within the switch  was dark in color. Employee #1 placed the fuse holder on the floor and then  raised the other two fuse holders and supported them on the fuse holder's  alignment dowels that were located on the side of the fuse holder  partially  suspending the fuse holder in the OFC switch. Employee #1 then assisted  Employee #2 in inspecting the malfunctioning transformer unit. After assisting  Employee #2 in the inspection of the transformer  Employee #1 returned to  inspect the remaining two fuses in the OFC switches. To inspect the fuses  Employee #1 had partially removed the fuse holder slightly from their  suspended positions in the OFC switch. Employee #1 looked at the fuse to  determine if the fuse was blown. Employee #1 then lowered the fuse holder back  into the OFC switch suspending the fuse holders on the alignment dowel pins.  After completing the inspection of the fuses  Employee #1 slightly rotated one  of the fuse holders so that it would be better supported. Immediately after  Employee #1 pulled his hand from the fuse holder he heard a \"pop\" sound. At  that time an arc flash occurred within the OFC switch. This arc flash caused  intense radiant heat and a short lived fire which expanded out of the OFC  switch into the electrical room burning Employee #1 Employee #2 and the  coworker who led them into the room. Employee #1 and #2 were hospitalized and  suffered from unspecified burns as a result of the event.",

The crews pour  approximately 330 cubic yards of concrete on the roof deck and near completion  when an area of roof deck dropped about 4-inches over a stairwell. The crew  attempted to lift the section of sinking roof deck by stabilizing the forms  from further movement. The foreman required the crew to work under the load in  attempt to lift the loaded roof deck false work forms. The crew placed a  hydraulic jack over a beam that was supporting their platform  and placed a  shore post between the jack and the sinking false work beam above. As the crew  applied pressure to the jack  the center platform supporting beam overloaded  and broke in half. Employee # 1  Employee # 2 and Employee # 3 fell 15  20 and  30 feet to the steel stairs below.

They were working northeast  of Baltimore  Maryland  near Kenwood Avenue and the Baltimore Beltway. The  crew had removed a 30-foot high steel camera pole at an interchange and had  secured the pole onboard a Ford National crane truck. Because a portion of the  pole was extending past the end of the truck  a safety vest was tied to the  end of the pole. The crew took the pole to the State Highway Administration  communication repair facility (\"radio yard\") at 5901 Baltimore National Pike   where they arrived around 1:30 p.m. Checking with the State Highway  Administration employees  they were instructed to place the pole next to a  previously placed pole up against the fence on the east side of the yard. The  crew foreman assigned the other two employees to set up the crane truck and to  unload the 30-foot-long steel pole. The pole weighed between 900 and 1 000  pounds. The truck was brought into place  and the straps were removed from the  pole. The crane's hook was unlatched and the pole was attached to the straps  and the crane hook. While this was going on  a State Highway Administration  truck with two employees inside drove into the yard; its driver asked the  crew's foreman a question about the camera that had been removed from the  pole. The foreman was standing at the driver's side of the State Highway  Administration truck with his back to the crane truck  about 25 to 30 feet  away from the crane truck. The crane operator  who was Employee #1  had  lowered the outriggers on the passenger's side of his crane truck  and the  landing pads were in place. The outriggers were lowered on the driver's side  but without the pads. None of the four outriggers was extended at all. The  crane operator raised the crane's boom and then the pole up and off the truck.  The groundman  who was Employee #2  was holding onto the safety vest tied to  the end of the pole to help steady the pole and to guide it to the storage  location. The pole had to travel up and over numerous fiber reels of various  sizes  some of them as high as 6 feet  3 inches. As the pole went over one of  the fiber reels  it contacted the reel  scratching the thumb of the groundman  and drawing blood. He let go of the safety vest  and the pole bounced. He  looked at his finger and started walking around the fiber reels to grab the  safety vest again. As he did  he noticed that the crane truck was tipping  over. He yelled to the operator to get off the truck. The operator jumped from  the bed of the truck  landing on his feet. The foreman and the State Highway  employees ran over to see if Employees #1 and #2 were alright. Employee #1   the crane operator  sustained bruises  contusions  and abrasions on his legs  in the jump from the truck. Employee #2  the groundman  sustained a laceration  on his finger. Neither employee sustained any further injury as a result of  the overturning of the crane truck  and neither was hospitalized.",

They were assigned to repair a broken heater in the store's  rear storage room. Employee #1 had been on site the previous day  December 10   2013  to review the scope of the assignment and the material involved.  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 replaced the electric contact on the heater.  Employee #1 then went to check the 480 Volt Westinghouse Fusible Distribution  Panelboard (FDP)  Category FDPT3833 #3 panelboard unit in the store's  electrical cage  located in a separate room adjacent to the storage room  to  make sure that the heater could be energized. The panelboard unit  measuring  approximately 8 inches tall by 14 inches long  was installed along with other  panelboard units  approximately 3 feet from concrete on grade. The panelboard  unit contained a shutoff switch on the front side of the dead front panel to  disconnect the interior front fuse panel from the live busbar that energized  the panel from the interior rear of the panel unit. Employee #1 turned the 480  Volt  60 Amp T3833 FDP #3 switch to the off position and opened the dead front  to expose the TRS90R 90 Amp fuses in the panel. After a visual inspection of  the interior of the panelboard unit  Employee #1 metered the fuses in the  panel to ensure that the fuse panel was not energized. He determined that two  of the three fuses were inoperable and needed replacement. Employee #1 removed  the fuses with an insulated fuse puller. He then wound up the electrical meter  and took off his gloves. The door to the panelboard had swung into an almost  closed position and sat slightly ajar  approximately 3 inches. Before starting  toward his vehicle to retrieve two new fuses  Employee #1 reached to shut the  electrical panel door  so that store employees would not be exposed to an  electrical hazard while he was gone. As Employee #1 shut the panel door  a  live T3833 FDP #1 panelboard unit  approximately 8 inches above the FDP #3  that Employee #1 had been working in  and that had not been previously opened  and was dead front  had one or more arc flashes. The flashes blew out the top  of the dead fronted T3833 FDP #1  causing irreparable blast and burn damage.  The interior of the T3833 FDP #3 had burn marks on a small section of the  panel door. Employee #1 was seriously burned. He also experienced brief  blindness due to the flash. Coworker #1  who had been standing to the side   approximately 3 feet from the panel unit  also experienced brief blindness   but was otherwise uninjured. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1  was transported and admitted to Tuomey Hospital  and subsequently transferred  by emergency transport to the Augusta Burn Center. He was treated for second  and third degree burns to his hand and forearm. South Carolina OSHA's  subsequent investigation determined that Employee #1 had been wearing ANSI  Class 2 - 17 000 Volt electrical gloves  a fire resistant shirt  and safety  glasses while working  although  as noted above  he had removed his gloves  shortly before the arc flash event.",

There were four sets of motor  and pump units in the boiler room. Two months prior to this job  Employee #1  had replaced one of these set. On the day of the accident  they were replacing  another motor and pump unit. All the valves were shut and the motor and pump  unit had been removed from the 12 in. hot water pipe when a motor from one of  the other three units automatically restarted. Employee #1 heard a whooshing  sound coming from the open water pipe  and 120 degress F water started to  spray out. Employee #1 attempted to cap off the pipe; Employee #2 went to  notify the hotel engineer and then returned to help Employee #1. The hotel  engineer was checking the valves and tightening some nuts and bolts on the  couplings when Employees #1 and #2 were suddenly sprayed with hot water.  Paramedics responded and both employees were taken to St. Francis Hospital.  Employee #1 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to his abdomen.  Employee #2 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to the back of his  legs. The employer was cited for two general accident-related violations. The  hotel had only one check valve for the 12 in. hot water pipe that served the  entire 42-story building. There were no other intermediate check valves  throughout the piping system. California Code of Regulations T8 3329(d)  states: \"When dismantling or opening closed pressurized or gravity fed  systems  internal pressure shall be relieved or other methods utilized to  prevent sudden release of pressure or spraying of liquid.\" One of the  functions of the check valve would have been to prevent backflow. It was  discovered after the incident that the check valve was not working properly.  As a result  it did not have the capacity to stop the water from flowing back  into the boiler room. The other general accident-related violations are from  T8 GISO section 3314(c) and (g)  which require a lockout/de-energizing of  electrical equipment. Prior to the removal of the motor and pump unit  the  other 3 units were not de-energized to prevent them from building-up water  pressure of a minimum of 20 psi. The boiler was also not shut down to prevent  build-up of water temperature. A hazard control procedure was not developed by  the employer. A reference was also made to T8 3314(i)  which required on-site  lockout procedures to be followed by outside servicing personnel.",

The lines were  in eight conduits along a road. Nitrogen was being used for the insulation. An  18-wheel trailer contained 10 tubes of nitrogen  with a total volume of  approximately 100 000 cubic feet. Four of the workers were standing on or  around the back of the trailer  and the superintendent was standing along the  left side of the trailer. Two workers were in a manhole and operating valves  where a hose attached to the manifold on the back of the trailer. The  superintendent instructed the crew to open the valves. He then noticed that  the valve on the manifold in line behind the nitrogen flow meter was leaking.  He said to close the valve  meaning to close the valve on the nitrogen tube.  Instead  the valve on the conduit in the manhole was closed. Closing this  valve caused a buildup of pressure. As a result of this pressure  the glass  portion of the flow meter failed and shattered. When the glass shattered   Employees #1  #2  #3  and #4 were struck by flying glass. They were  transported to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC Health).  Employees #1  #2  and #4 were treated for cuts and bruises to the face  and  Employee #3 was treated for cuts to the left wrist. Employee #1 was admitted  for an overnight stay.

The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft  steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel  supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in.  bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow  of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the  trough onto the supports  and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a  neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to  stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the  neighboring trough system  while another employee tack welded the two troughs  systems together. This procedure exposed Employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The  employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied  off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As Employee #1 stood upon the  uneven trough  a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing  another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly  20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever  from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with  brackets in order to prevent this from occurring.

        "summary": "At approximately 9:15 a.m. on June 19  2012  Employee #1  a laborer employed  by Cleveland Wrecking Company  was engaged in demolishing a floating roof type  storage tank  approximately 130 feet in diameter and 40 feet tall  at a  non-operational PG&E; power plant. He was positioned approximately 40 feet  above the ground  on the platform of a Genie telescopic boom lift  Model  Number S-60  Serial Number S6007-15084. Employee #1 had previously cut an  entrance 24 feet high by 21 feet wide on the east side of the tank to access  the inside of the tank with the lift. At the time of the accident  he had  finished cutting vertically over the center of the entrance to the tank  and  then had positioned the boom lift just north of the vertical cut he had made.  He elevated the lift basket over the tank to signal a coworker  who was  operating the excavator  to push in the wall section to the south of the cut  employee #1 had made. As the coworker pushed the south wall section inward  with the excavator  the wall section north of the vertical cut also collapsed  inward and struck the boom lift. The boom lift was knocked backwards. It  overturned and hit the floor of the tank. Employee #1 sustained blunt force  trauma to his head  chest  abdomen  and pelvic area. He died from these  injuries. The accident was reported to Cal/OSHA's Bakersfield District office  by the employer at 11:10 a.m. on June 19  2012. Investigation revealed that  one day before the accident  Employee #1 partially removed a section of the  tank girder. This girder was located 3 feet from the top of the tank and  extended around the outside of the tank. The girder was removed from just  north of the tank entrance to about one-fourth way around the northeast side  of the tank. Removing the girder contributed to the instability of the tank.  The tank wall section that was cut just prior to the accident was  approximately 40 feet high and did not have any lateral support. No civil  engineering data was available at the time of the incident substantiating the  capability of any of the wall sections over one story or 12 feet in height to  stand alone without lateral support.",

        "summary": "On the morning of September 27  2007  Employee #1  of the Alarcon Bohm  Corporation  was working as a laborer cleaning up debris from the ongoing  demolition of a mezzanine structure inside a building in South San Francisco   CA. At approximately 7:30 a.m. that same day  a coworker used a reciprocating  saw to make a series of cuts from above on the mezzanine floor  releasing one  end of a floor support truss section that was about 20 ft long and weighed an  estimated 80 to 100 lb. The other end remained connected to a beam above the  main floor. The free end of the truss then swung downward about 11 ft to the  floor  striking Employee #1 as he was walking under it. The truss landed on  his lower right leg  fracturing the tibia and fibula. Employee #1 was  transported to Peninsula Hospital  where he underwent surgery on his leg; he  was released on September 28  2007. At the time of the accident  another  laborer and an Alarcon foreman were standing nearby. The coworker cutting the  trusses free could not be seen by Employee #1  as he had walked about 60 ft  from his previous position under the mezzanine to the point where he was  struck. Subsequent investigation found that no barricades or warning tapes  were in place on the floor areas underneath the mezzanine to prevent workers  from walking into the danger zone where the trusses were being removed. In  addition  the floor support trusses were being taken down by hand without the  use of scaffolding  elevating work platforms or aerial devices for employee  safety. The employer was cited for violations of T8CCR 1735(o)  Demolishing  Buildings: Planks spanning the distance between adequate beams shall be used  where necessary as asubstitute for weakened floors  and as access walkways  over open or weakened areas. When demolishing floors and roofs  employees  shall be prohibited from working below this activity. Demolition of floor  spaces shall continue until all unsupported flooring is removed. When  employees are required to remove floor support beams  wall sections  etc.  by  hand  scaffolding as described in Article 21 of the Construction Safety Orders  or elevating work platforms and aerial devices as described in Article 24 of  the General Industry Safety Orders shall be provided and used where necessary  to insure employee safety. The employer was also cited for a violation of  T8CCR 1736(f)  Disposal of Waste Material: When debris is dropped through  holes in the floor without the use of chutes  the area onto which the material  is dropped shall be completely enclosed with barricades not less than 42 in.  high  and not less than 6 ft back from the projected edge of the opening  above. Signs warning of the hazard of falling materials shall be posted at  each level. Debris removal shall not be permitted in this lower drop area  until debris handling ceases above.",

Employee #2 was working as the driver of a CAT AP-1055D Track  Asphalt Paver  and was working in the vicinity of a dump truck that was  loading asphalt into the paver. There had been over 40 similar loads made that  day  all with the hitch arm assembly of the paver fully extended outward to  allow the truck bed to get in a clear position for the dump. A spotter had  also been present for all of these earlier loads  and the job of this spotter  was to assist the alignment of the paver and truck. On this particular dump   the paver's operator was not aware that he had laterally retracted the left  and right hitch arms at the front of the paver  moving the arms inward  while  the dump truck carrying asphalt was backing up to offload asphalt into the  paver's hopper. The spotter was also absent during this particular dump. The  dump truck pulled in at an angle and the paver's left hitch arm was embedded  between the outside and inside left rear tires on the rear axle of the dump  truck. Employee #2 then drove the paver forward for about 15 feet before  stopping with the hitch arm stuck in the rear tires. Employee #1 was called to  the scene of the accident and tried to determine a way of disengaging the two  vehicles. Employee #1 was standing between an adjacent roadway gate and within  three feet of the vehicles. There was a blowout of the inside right tire of  the dump truck. Employee #1 said he took one or two steps backward and was  unconscious for a time where he landed on the opposite side of the gate rail.  Employee #1 suffered initial bruising and concussive injuries to his ribs   head  neck and back and non-permanent facial dermal injuries from mixed flying  debris from the tire blowout. He was hospitalized for over 24 hours at  Stanford Hospital. The Division did not issue an accident-related citation  because no violation of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations was  determined to have caused the accident. Operator error appeared to be a  primary factor in the incident. However  the operator had at least 3 years of  experience in that position. Employer stated there had never been a prior  instance of this particular sequence of events or results and has taken  effective steps to ensure or limit the chance of such reoccurrence.

The pad was  approximately 62-ft by 113-ft long with a sloping grade from front to rear of  pad. The pad was roughly 22-ft high at the rear of the pad. Employee #1 was  operating the compactor the length of the pad from front to back. The employee  had been operating the compactor for an hour when the compactor throttled went  down on its own towards the end of the pad. The vibrator function on the  compactor was still engaged tamping the ground. Before Employee #1 could turn  off the vibrator  the ground began to give way causing the compactor to slide  sideways and begin to roll over onto its side. Employee #1 who was wearing his  seat belt  as is company policy  unhooked the seat belt and attempted to jump  to safety by leaping in the direction that the paving compactor was falling.  The employee hit the ground and before he could get up to run  he was struck  by the roll over protection on the compactor and pinned underneath the machine  for approximately one hour before a passerby heard him screaming for help.  Employee #1 turned off the paving compactor vibrator by using a marker stake  that was next to him and using it to depress the on/off switch. The machine  ran for approximately 20 minutes before the engine locked up on the machine.  Emergency Medical Service transported Employee #1 to a local hospital  where  he was treated for a broken pelvis  legs and damage to the urethra. Employee  #1 remains hospitalized.",

The work project involved seismic  retrofitting of the parking structure. The employee's crew was to waterproof  the vertical wall of an elevator shaft. The area adjacent to the elevator  shaft had been excavated to install waterproofing fabric. The excavation was  approximately 44 inches deep and 4.5 feet wide. Earlier that morning  the  General Contractor  C. Overaa & Co.  had been collecting scrap lumbers on a  platform made out of a 0.75 in. thick plywood board supported by two 7-foot  planks (1.5 in. by 9.5 in.) placed over the excavation 3 to 4 feet apart. At  the time the employee and crew began work  the scrap lumbers and the board had  been removed but the planks remained over the excavated area. At approximately  7:45 a.m.  the employee stepped on one of the two planks to cross over the  excavated area. The plank broke  and the employee fell approximately 4 feet.  He landed on his right heel  and his right heel bone shattered. Paramedics  transported him to Kaiser in San Francisco  where his broken foot was  immobilized for later surgery  which was performed August 8  2011.  Investigation determined the cause of the accident was a single  damaged plank  used to cross over the excavation. The employer was cited with one General  Citation. T8 CCR 1624(a) requires runways or ramps for the use of workers to  be at least 20 inches wide and to be properly supported as to avoid deflection  and springing action. The general contractor had provided a dirt ramp and  ladder for access to the excavated area and therefore was not cited.",

The vault was located at a residential construction site in Fremont   California. According to Employee #1  who was the only witness on the day of  the accident  his immediate supervisor told him to connect cables to the  switchgear; therefore  he went to the switchgear to do the requested work.  Employee #1 opened the lid to the vault at approximately 8:30 a.m. Employee #1  placed a ladder into the vault to descend into the vault. Employee #1 stood on  the top of the switchgear and Employee #1 did not notice any vibration or  noise coming from the switchgear. This contributed to Employee #1 believing  the switchgear was not energized. Employee #1 proceeded to remove three candle  elbows for terminal conductor points or bushings on the switchgear so that  Employee #1 could begin connecting cables to the switchgear. When Employee #1  removed the third or last candle elbow  an electrical flash or large ball of  light occurred. The flash generated a loud bang. Employee #1 felt a  substantial amount of pain. Employee #1 tried to ascend the nearby ladder to  get out of the underground vault. Employee #2  who heard the loud bang  went  to help Employee #1 get out of the underground vault. Employee #3 called for  emergency assistance. The gloves worn by Employee #1 had holes/tears from the  electricity that entered/exited Employee #1's hands. The gloves were Tool  Handz PLUS Reinforced Snug-Fitting types. On the day of the accident  the  weather was sunny. There was no water in the underground vault. Employee #1  did not receive electrical safety training dealing with high voltage  equipment. Employee #1 is not certified as an electrician/electrical trainee  in the state of California. Employee #1 had never used any voltage testing  equipment to determine if conductors/equipment are energized. According to  Pacific Gas and Electric  which owns the switchgear  the accident resulted in  182 customers losing power. After the accident  Employee #1 was admitted to  Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley  California  but was later admitted to  Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose  California. Employee #1 was  admitted to both hospitals on May 13  2008. Employee #1 suffered third and  second degree burns to hands  and first degree burns to entire surface of the  face to the neck. Employee #1 also suffered temporary loss of hair on his head  and face. The employer failed to provide any electrical safety training  records for Employee #1 after the employer was given a request for safety  training records. The cause of the accident was Employee #1 performed  electrical work on energized equipment/switchgear without using proper safety  controls for energized equipment. These controls include using voltage testing  equipment before performing electrical work to determine if equipment was  energized  having only a qualified electrical worker perform work on high  voltage equipment  wearing safety gloves that are rated for voltage that may  be encountered  and following proper de-energizing provisions for work on high  voltage equipment.",

Employee #1 was at the bottom of a 53 ft wide by  150 ft long excavation that had a maximum depth of 37 ft. He was holding an  engineering rod so that a coworker  who was also the superintendent  could  obtain elevation measurements to determine the actual depth. It was decided  that the base of the excavation needed to be leveled so another coworker began  using a Caterpillar 330C excavator to scrape the bottom and remove the excess  earth. The excavator was located on an 18 ft 6 in. deep ramp on the north end  of the excavation. Employee #1 was still in the excavation when the east wall  caved in. The initial collapse covered him up to his knees and he stated that  he would extricate himself using a hand shovel. Within 30 seconds  a second  collapse occurred that completely engulfed him. Employee #1 died of asphyxia.  Subsequent investigation found the upper portions of the excavation on the  west and south side were sloped. The east wall was previously excavated and  had not been sloped due to the location of the old lift station on its border.  The north side contained the ramp that that held the excavator. Causal factors  in the accident were the failure to properly apply protective  anti-cave-in  systems. This was exacerbated by vibrations caused by the excavator  which was  in use while Employee #1 was still working within the excavation. The failure  to remove the existing sewer lift station also caused the excavation to be  unstable because the slab for the building had been undermined.",

Using a rotary hand-held  saw  he began to cut off the top of the concrete form for the structure  to  make it even. He was holding the rotary saw with both hands while he was  cutting  but when he leaned to his left he began to lose his balance. He let  go of the saw with his right hand to steady himself  but accidentally put it  down on the saw  which was still in the cutting position in his left hand.  Four fingers on his right hand were severely lacerated by the operating saw.  Emergency personnel transported him to a local medical center  where he was  hospitalized for treatment and surgery to reattach one finger.

He proceeded to the lake but was unable to find the  Model Number D9H bulldozer or Employee #1. Employee #1 had driven the  Caterpillar bulldozer into the lake  while moving fill material  and he  drowned. The Investigation revealed that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was in  reverse  and the throttle position was at full  as confirmed by underwater  photographs. The transmission had three forward and three reverse gears. For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern. The reason for the left to right pattern was to slowly extend  the line of fill into the lake consistently  so that it could support the  weight of the equipment. It appears that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was on  this central peninsula  which failed under the weight  and caused the  bulldozer and Employee #1 to enter the lake.",

One of the journeyman power line workers was  using the controls on the side of the truck to operate the auger. He moved the  auger about a half meter away from the newly dug hole to provide clearance for  the apprentice to hand clean it. The apprentice used a metal-blade putty knife  to scrape the dirt from the auger. The boom operator raised the auger to make  it easier for the apprentice to reach the lower blade area. When the auger was  approximately 610 millimeters above the ground  the boom contacted the power  line  electrocuting the apprentice. He had not been wearing rubber insulating  gloves while he was cleaning the auger. The digger-derrick had not been  grounded.",

The ground on which the crane was set up consisted of a  loose stone base and concrete. The left rear outrigger was positioned on loose  stone and double-span blocked on wood timbers. The right rear outrigger was  blocked on a single set of wood blocks at the edge of the boardwalk. The right  front outrigger was set on concrete with wood outrigger blocking stacked and  spanned. The left front outrigger blocking was set on concrete with wood  blocking double-stacked and spanned. The pieces of wood used for blocking were  not uniform. Although the site had been examined before the crane's outriggers  were extended into place  the soil under the concrete on which the right rear  outrigger was positioned had eroded. The erosion over time created a void in  the soil  and as the third boat was lifted  the concrete in this area cracked.  The crane then tipped over into the river. The operator rode the crane into  the river and managed to escape from the cab before the crane went underwater.  He broke out a glass window in the cab and swam free of the crane. He was then  pulled from the water by coworkers. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that the  operator was taken to the hospital for examination and observation. Injuries  were limited to bruises and minor cuts. He was not hospitalized. The injury  line says the crane operator received no injuries. During an inspection of the  lift site after the accident  a sink hole or erosion point behind the seawall  was noticed about 150 feet to the southwest of the lift area.

Her employer had been subcontracted  by the general contractor  Bechtel. This work required working on scaffolding.  Employee #1 was working on the second deck of the scaffolding  above grade   and helping Coworker #1 install insulation. The foreman  Coworker #2  was  working on a level above Employee #1. Employee #1's immediate supervisor   Coworker #3  was working at another location on site and checking on Employee  #1 approximately every 20 minutes  as needed. There was a large crew that day   with frequent supervision. Employee #1 was summoned to come down to ground  level to assist. Upon exiting the gate at the scaffold rail  Employee #1  descended the ladder. At a level of approximately 8 feet above the ground   Employee #1 lost her footing and fell. She landed on her side  striking a  standoff-supported 6-inch diameter pipe. The Hayward Fire Department responded  to a call for emergency assistance and transported Employee #1 to the  hospital  where she was admitted and treated for fractured ribs  a punctured  right lung  and bruises to her right kidney and right leg. The Hayward Fire  Department reported this event to Cal/OSHA at 9:20 p.m. on March 8  2013   leaving a message with the Cal/OSHA Division's after-hours messaging service.  The employer also attempted to report the event to Cal/OSHA but inadvertently  called the local Federal OSHA office. A Cal/OSHA representative contacted the  employer on March 11  2013. The subsequent investigation found no obvious  causal factor. Employee #1 was not carrying anything while descending the  ladder  and the scaffolding and its ladder were observed to have been properly  erected by Bechtel. The investigator's report concluded that Employee #1's  injuries appeared to have been the result of a simple error in footwork.",

When the lifting cable broke  the  spud was allowed to free-fall pulling the cable from the deck winch with it.  The deck winch cable tightened as the spud fell creating a pinch point between  the cable and the spud support located on the deck of the spud barge. The  pinch was created when a lifting cable attached to a spud broke allowing the  item it was holding (the spud) to free fall which caused a second alignment  cable that was also attached to the spud to become tight.

In preparation  the employees  deenergized a 200-ampere electric power and lighting panelboard located on the  second level of the mall. The panelboard was fed by the defective disconnect   which had an open pole. Next  the electrician (Employee #1) opened the  disconnect switch  disconnected the load-side 3/0 AWG conductors  and  reconnected then to a 400-ampere disconnect in an adjacent section of the  switchgear. The electrician discovered that the A-phase internal bus hardware  of the defective 200-ampere switch  including the fuse holder  was discolored  from long-term overheating. This was similar to a problem he had encountered  less than a month ago at another 200-ampered fusible disconnect within the  same low-voltage switchboard. The problem with that disconnect  which was  directly above the disconnect on which he was working that day  was also on  the A-phase. Upon completion of these tasks  the electrician closed only the  400-ampere disconnect and called his employer to explain what he had found.  The employer (Employee #3) and the mechanical superintendent of the mall  (Employee #2) met the electrician at the switchboard.

They were  replacing it with a receiving/transmitting dish. Employee #1 had to go into  the aluminum framing  which supports the reflector and secures it to the  tower  to attach the bridle sling for a tag line used to keep the reflector  and framing from hitting the tower while it is being lowered to the ground.  While out in the reflector framing  the employee must attach his safety belt  lanyard to the framing rather to the tower. Employee #1 was on the reflector  framing when the bolts at the top securing bracket sheared  and the top of the  unit began peeling away from the tower  pulling the bottom bracket off the  tower. The reflector unit and Employee #1 fell to the ground  where he died of  massive head and trunk trauma. The brackets  nuts  and bolts securing  reflector framing to the tower had been checked before Employee #1 went into  the framing and appeared to be normal. The company had a contract to perform  this work on a series of microwave relay towers and had already done several  without a problem. However  this particular tower was located adjacent to the  Gulf of Mexico and the corrosive effect of salt air on aluminum and steel  brackets secured with aluminum nuts and bolts had not been considered. This  corrosion was not detectable without disassembly of the brackets.",

Employee #1 was applying the wall  coating for approximately 20 minutes using an airless spray gun and an  electric piston pump. During that time  Employee #1 may have applied as mush  as 8 gallons of the wall coating and generated significant concentrations of  vaporized and aerosolized hydrocarbons in the studio. Prior to spraying   Employee #1 had closed and covered the windows and shut the self-locking door  of the studio. The studio was not ventilated during the spraying. Another  employee found Employee #1 lying unconscious  face up on the floor of the  studio's walk-in closet  approximately 40 minutes after spraying had  commenced. The apartment complex maintenance manager assisted another employee  with carrying Employee #1 out of the studio. The maintenance manager stated  that the studio air had a strong odor and a heavy visible mist of overspray.  The maintenance manager performed a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  emergency medical procedure on Employee #1 before he was transferred to the  hospital. Employee #1 died the next day. Representatives of the county medical  examiner's office concluded that Employee #1's death was accidental and was  caused by inhalation of vaporized and aerosolized hydrocarbons while spray  painting in an enclosed environment. Employee #1 was not wearing his  respirator at the time he was discovered unconscious  although the lack of  overspray on his face and the significant amount of overspray on the hair of  his head suggested that he had been wearing the respirator while spraying. The  employer required Employee #1 both to provide and to wear the full-face  negative pressure respirator with a canister that was sitting near him in the  studio. The respirator and its canister were not NIOSH-approved. The employer  did not have a Respiratory Protection Program  and was unable to provide the  required documentation  showing that Employee #1 had completed a respiratory  medical questionnaire  had been fit tested for his respirator  and had been  trained in the use of his respirator. At the time of this incident  Employee  #1 had worked for the employer for approximately two weeks during which he had  spray coated other apartments.

He was taken to San Francisco General Hospital for evaluation and treatment.  He was admitted at 2:37 p.m. on August 16  2010  and was discharged at 8:40  p.m. on August 17  2010. Employee #1 said he used a ladder resting on a beam  near the area where he was working. Employee #1 said the ladder was not  extended above the beam  since a coworker was fixing a bolt next to the  ladder. The coworker  in an interview  stated that he was fixing a bolt on a  beam located across from where Employee #1 was working during the accident.  The coworker said he was working next to a ladder that he set up that morning.  According to the coworker  Employee #1 used the ladder to ascend  but he did  not see Employee #1 use the ladder to go down. The coworker said he did not  see how Employee #1 fell. Employee #1 was already on the ground when he saw  him. Photographs taken on the day of the accident by the general contractor   Lathrop Construction Associates  confirmed the coworker's statement on the  location of the ladder. The ladder was resting on a beam next to where the  coworker was working. Employee #1 was not tied off when he was hit by the bent  plate that had become detached from a beam. The steel plate that hit Employee  #1 was the bent plate he was working on  cutting the welds  prior to the  accident. Photographs taken by the general contractor showed the bent steel  plate detached from a beam. Photographs did not show a ladder next to the area  where Employee #1 was working.",

He was part of  a small crew assigned to paint a commercial space in the basement of a  shopping mall. Employee #1 was alone on the scaffold and using a spray gun to  paint the ceiling and upper areas of the room. Employee #1 fell from the  scaffold platform to the floor  a distance of approximately 7 feet. The San  Mateo Fire Department responded to a call for assistance. Employee #1 was  transported to Stanford Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for a  fractured skull and fractured left wrist. This event was timely reported to  Cal/OSHA by the employer and the San Mateo Fire Department. The subsequent  investigation determined that Employee #1 was working with Coworker #1 to  paint the area. Coworker #2  the crew foreman  was supervising Employee #1 and  Coworker #1. Another worker  Coworker #3  only had assisted with the scaffold  set-up at the start of the shift. Employee #1 and Coworker #2 stated the  scaffold platform was set at 7 feet  and they did not have enough room to  install both 4-foot guardrail end-sections and X-bracing for rails because the  fluorescent light fixtures were 11 feet above the floor. Both said that all  four wheel brakes were applied at the time of the fall. Coworkers #1 and #2  said they did not see Employee #1 actually fall off the scaffold and that  Employee #1 was the only worker on the scaffold. Employee #1 said he cannot  recall the actual fall but thinks he may have lost his balance. Coworkers #1  and #2 said that no ladders  buckets  or other objects were being used to gain  greater working height at the time of the fall. All four employees who had  involvement at the site stated that there were no defects or problems with the  scaffold. The scaffold was set up and measured during Cal/OSHA's inspection of  the site  and the platform was less than 7 feet 6 inches above surface  so  guardrails were not required in this configuration  per Section 1646. No  precipitating action for the fall was definitively established. Employee #1  may have fallen as he was coming down off the scaffold  or as he lost balance  on the platform  or by accidentally stepping past the platform edge.

The four fundamental  components of the Alvey machine consist of the following: the computer  the  carousel  the Inserter and Extruder car  and the conveyor systems with its  adjoining palletizers. As the Alvey machine was used in the Greeley meat  packing facility  the boxed or packaged beef was temporarily stored in 22  individual  30-feet high carousels. As the computer was instructed to fill an  order for distribution and shipping  the Inserter and Extruder car's robot arm  would seek or home onto the selected carousel slot  retrieve the boxed beef   and then descend to the lowest point at ground level and release the boxed  beef onto the conveyor system. At this point  the boxed beef would travel to  its distribution point to be loaded onto a truck to be delivered to the  customer. The Alvey machine was not de-energized  nor locked out  and Employee  #1 wore no fall protection. While Employee #1 was connecting the platform to  the catwalk  adjacent to  in  and around the path of travel of the Inserter  and Extruder car of the Alvey machine  the car struck the construction worker.
