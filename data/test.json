They worked here for a while before Employee #1 told crew members that he was  going out to look at the lines and possibly do some administrative work.  Shortly after that  an outage on the existing line section was reported by the  power company to MJ's general foreman  who reported this to the  superintendent. They both checked their site preparation crew members because  it was clear to the line crew that they were not to be working on the live  existing lines until given authorization from the General Foreman  who would  first receive clearance from the power company and certify that the circuit  was deenergized. After accounting for crews they thought were in the vicinity  of the live lines  the general foreman and the superintendent directed the  power company to restore power to the existing lines. Very shortly after this   an ATV rider discovered Employee #1 burning in a transmission tower  approximately 45 ft above the ground. The rider used Employee #1's radio to  notify the company of his discovery. The general foreman directed the power  company to shut down the power and summoned emergency responders. Numerous MJ  crews and personnel traveled to the scene to assist.

Two 10 ft  tall by 20 ft long trench boxes  with 44 in. spreaders  were in use. The  initial excavation was 20 ft deep  but an excavator using a 32 in. shovel had  then dug between the trench boxes to a depth of approximately 22 ft. The  result was that the trench boxes sat on two \"shelves \" each approximately 2 to  3 ft in height. A section of soil  approximately 18 in. wide by 2 to 3 ft deep  by 3 ft long  caved into the trench from the 3 ft high shelf on which the  trench boxes were positioned. The dirt struck Employee #1 on the back of his  legs  knocking him down to his knees. The coworker acting as top man saw the  cave-in and alerted the excavator operator  the foreman  and the loader  operator. The coworker and the loader operator climbed down into the trench  and began shoveling dirt off Employee #1. As they did this  a second cave-in  occurred  coming from the same area. The dirt flowed from under the trench  box  covering Employee #1 over the back of his legs. The two coworkers  continued to shovel for another five minutes and had nearly cleared enough  soil to free him when a third substantial collapse occurred  coming from under  the trench box and from around the front of the east end of the trench boxes.  This collapse engulfed Employee #1 up to his waist and knocked down the  coworker who had witnessed the first cave-in  covering the coworker's legs in  soil  and trapping him as well. The foreman was now also down in the trench   shoveling dirt off the coworker. He was eventually able to pull himself free  of the collapsed soil and then left the trench  exhausted from shoveling.  Rescue personnel from the Sommers Fire Department arrived at the site and took  over rescue operations. A fourth cave-in occurred that replaced the soil  previously removed. The Summers Fire Department called in the SRT Units from  Lake County  IL  for assistance. During the rescue attempt  which lasted over  an hour  soil continued to flow into the trench from beneath the trench box on  the north side and from around the front (east) side of the open-ended trench  box. No protective shielding was in place east of the trench box. The soil was  sloped from about the 15 ft depth level back up to the excavator position   which was about 15 ft to the east. At approximately 10:30 a.m.  a significant  collapse occurred that fully engulfed Employee #1; he died of mechanical  asphyxiation. In a preliminary assessment of the protective measures taken   the top of Employee #1's head was found to be 23 ft below the top of the  trench box. His knees were measured at approximately 25 ft from the top of the  trench box. Tabulated data provided on the trench boxes indicated that they  could be used up to a depth of 35 ft for class A soil  22 ft for class B soil   and 17 ft for class C soil. Preliminary soil classification performed in the  field identified the soil as class C. Clay soil comprised approximately the  top 8 ft  with sand (a class C soil) comprising the bottom layer. Clay soil  located over a C sand soil was classified as a class C soil. Soil samples were  taken from three different locations  including soil excavated during the  recovery. The recovery effort took approximately 13 hours.
