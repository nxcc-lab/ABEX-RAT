Prior to the accident  Employee #1 (the  flagman) and a coworker (the crane operator) had been off-loading crane  counterweights from flatbed trucks utilizing a rented Link-Belt  60-ton  hydraulic boom  all terrain crane  Model RTC - 8060 (Serial #E1I8-7579)  that  had arrived at the site the evening before. Unknown to the crane operator  the  crane's computer had been configured in the \"Jib Out\" mode. During the first  lift of the counterweight from the flatbed truck  the crane's computer kicked  out. The crane operator was able to set the counterweight down and lifted a  second counterweight  causing the computer to kick out again. The operator had  to immediately set the counterweight down on top of another counterweight   without properly seating it to the counterweight underneath  leaving it in an  unstable position. The crane operator was not familiar with the crane's  computer and was not able to determine what was wrong with the crane. The  company's job superintendent (an iron worker) got up into the crane and was  able to determine that the cranes' computer was not properly configured for  the boom configuration being used (\"Jib In Stowed Position\"). The job  superintendent was able to reconfigure the computer  and Employee #1 and his  coworkers continued off-loading the crane parts from trucks arriving at the  site. Before off-loading more counterweights  they attempted to reposition the  last counterweight off-loaded. Employee #1 and a coworker set the hooks at the  end of the rigging to the counterweight lift points. Employee #1 positioned  himself between the counterweight being lifted and counterweights that were  previously off-loaded (approximately one foot of space). Employee #1 gave the  signal to the crane operator to begin tightening up the rigging to set the  hooks. The crane boom was not centered over the load and when the crane  operator began to boom up  one hook set  raising the counterweight to a height  that allowed it to slide and rotate. Employee #1 was crushed between the  counterweight being lifted and other counterweights that had been stacked  behind him. As soon as the crane operator saw what happened  he repositioned  the counterweight and emergency services were called to the scene. Employee #1  was transported to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and was subsequently  air evacuated to St. Johns Regional Medical Center in Joplin  Missouri  where  he died from his injuries.

The first story structure had been  completed. The columns had been secured by anchor bolts  but the beams were  held in place by temporary tack welds. The on-site supervisor then directed  that the second-story columns be put in place before the temporary tack welds  were replaced with permanent welds. This is the normal practice. At one point   a column for the second level was bolted to a beam in error  and a crane was  needed to remove it. Employee #1 placed a ladder against the column and  climbed it with a choker sling. His weight and that of the ladder against the  column broke the tack welds holding its supporting beam. The beam rotated away  from Employee #1  causing the ladder to fall with the column and its beam.  Employee #1 jumped off the ladder a distance of about 10 feet to the cement  pad below. He sustained a fracture to his right leg. Employee #2  working on  the ground near the base of the ladder but with his back to the event   sustained a fracture to the left leg  as well as other injuries. Employee #1  was hospitalized  but there is no injury line for Employee #2. The main causal  factor for this accident was inadequate bracing of the column.                  ",

The  injured Employee #1  an apprentice elevator mechanic was working with a  foreman and mechanic for the installation of a new hydraulic elevator into a 3  level office building. There were two personnel assigned to the crew for this  installation. At the time of the accident the foreman was at the bottom of the  hoist way about 19 feet below the landing where Employee #1 was working near  the hoist way opening on level 2.

The materials to be lowered included six   sixteen-foot metal elevator rails. Employee #1 would attach the end of the  hoist line to the leading end of the rail through a hole in the rail end and  then manually lift the trailing end and walk it forward while straddling it as  the foreman ran the capstan motor until the trailing end cleared the landing  at the 2nd floor level  at which point the rail was then lowered down to the  bottom. Employee #1 experienced difficulty untying the first rail they lowered  because the shackle in the end of the 16 ft. rail was 3 ft. below the edge of  the hoist way 2nd level landing when it reached bottom  requiring him to reach  down into the hoist way to disconnect it. He next utilized some 1\/2 inch nylon  rope to extend the hoist line length and lifted four more rails in this manner  which allowed him to disconnect without leaning into the hoist way  however he  was not wearing or using the available fall protection equipment during these  lifts. The nylon rope apparently loosened while lifting the final rail  but  this occurred before the trailing end had cleared the edge of the 2nd level  landing. Employee #1 was about 3 feet from the edge of the hoist way when the  leading end of the rail began to drop downward and the trailing end began to  shift back into the 2nd level landing.

The employee's fall was reported to  the employer  the project's General Contractor  at 1:07 p.m. on March 14   2013. Cal\/OSHA opened its investigation on April 4  2013. (The investigation  report did not indicate when Cal\/OSHA was notified  and the reason for the  three-week delay in opening this case was unclear.) Cal\/OSHA's investigation  determined that the ladder involved was a Special Duty Type 1AA  2011 Werner  Co. 6-foot A-frame ladder with a 375-pound load capacity. The investigation  report concluded that the employee's fall was caused by the employer failing  to prohibit employees from carrying equipment or materials which prevent the  safe use of ladders. By carrying a large  heavy piece of plywood up the  ladder  the employee appeared to have lost his balance.

This truck  contained steel shapes of I-Beams  angles  flat bars  and channels. The  employer had its senior supervisor  two riggers and a record keeper assigned  to receive and unload this delivery. The employer reported the unloading was  discussed by the supervisor with his men and the slings were inspected. The  forklift unloaded six pieces of angles weighing 2 322 pounds  and four pieces  of flat bars weighing 1 225 lbs. This was reported to be ineffective and the  employer arranged for a 250-ton crane owned and operated by Bragg Crane to do  the job. The crane was equipped with 10 ft wire rope slings. The employer  added nylon slings to the wire rope slings to spread the load. They first  picked four pieces of I-Beams weighing 8 800 lbs. This was lifted from the  truck over the boom of a 28-ton crane parked alongside the truck into the  stacking area. The second pick consisted of two pieces of I-Beams weighing  5 200 lbs. The supervisor left and assigned the record keeper to coordinate  the work. The flagman instructed the employees to lift everything in one load.  The third load consisted of 12 pieces of steel channels weighing 24 480  pounds. This load was over the rated capacity of the nylon slings which was  only 6 900 pounds in a choker hitch. A sling broke and the load crushed  Employee #1  killing him.                                                       ",

        "summary":" At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 21  2013  Employee #1  a painter  employed by a construction contractor  was engaged in interior  remodeling\/alterations work at a restaurant. His employer was the general  contractor for the project. However  there was no foreman at the site  and all  workers other than Employee #1 were employed by subcontractors. Employee #1  was patching drywall near and on the 14-foot ceiling while standing on a  Werner 10-foot fiberglass step ladder. This extra heavy duty ladder had a  rated working load of 300 pounds. Employee #1 was 5 feet 4 inches tall and  weighed 163 pounds. Employee #1 was holding the patching compound and spatula  while standing on the second step below the topcap of the step ladder. The  ladder tipped to one side  and Employee #1 fell to the ground  a fall height  of 10 feet. Nearby subcontractor workers heard the fall and saw Employee #1  lying on the ground in pain. They phoned a foreman who was at another  location. The foreman came to the restaurant and called for emergency  services. An ambulance arrived  and Employee #1 was transported to San  Francisco General Hospital. He was admitted and treated for compressed neck  vertebrae  a large hematoma on the right upper side of his head  nerve damage   and spinal pain. He remained hospitalized for four days. This event was  reported to Cal\/OSHA on either December 21 or December 23  2013  by a relative  of Employee #1. During the subsequent investigation  begun at the job site on  January 10  2014  interviews were conducted with the employer  Employee #1   and Employee #1's relative. It was established that Employee #1 was standing  on the second step below the ladder's topcap  and this step was 7 feet 8  inches above the ground. He was leaning past the ladder side rails while  patching the drywall. His work position contributed to his fall. The  investigation revealed conflicting versions of what happened next and how soon  the ambulance arrived. Initially  the size and height of the step ladder also  were in dispute. According to Employee #1  after he fell he had to wait  approximately 45 minutes for a foreman to arrive from another jobsite. When  the foreman arrived  he removed the fallen ladder and wanted to move Employee  #1 to his (Employee #1's) house before contacting an ambulance. Employee #1   who was still on the ground  was screaming in pain and said not to move or  touch him and to call the ambulance. The foreman finally made the call for  emergency services. In contrast  according to the employer  a foreman employed  by another company  who was doing the employer a favor by opening up the  jobsite while the employer was away in Canada  called him and reported the  fall event to him. The employer then instructed the foreman to go to the  jobsite. According to the employer  who stated he was on the phone with the  foreman the entire time  it took the foreman approximately 10 minutes to  arrive at the job site. When the foreman arrived  the employer told him to  call emergency services. Based on the Cal\/OSHA investigation  the employer was  cited a general accident-related violation: T8 CCR '3276(e)(15)(A) requires  employees to work near the middle of the step and not to overreach. Other  standards relating to ladders were violated  and the employer was cited  accordingly. However  the investigation was not able to establish employer  knowledge. At the time of the investigation report  Employee #1 was taking six  different prescribed medications daily  wearing a frontal neck brace to  minimize vertical movement  and walking with a cane. He had experienced three  seizures  each requiring emergency services and transport to the hospital. In  addition  Workers' Compensation documents had not been given to Employee #1   and he had not received wages for the work performed on December 21  2013  the  day of the fall.

Two 35 ft wide by 20 ft long scaffolds were  positioned parallel to one another  and were 135 ft above the water on the  north and south sides of the 47 ft span. The scaffolds were designed in 1971  specifically for bridge painting and maintenance. This contractor was using  the scaffolding to perform structural steel work. Each platform weighed  approximately 3 000 lb and was designed to be suspended from 10 trolley  supports  except while the platform was being moved. At that time  four  trolley supports per support beam  or a total of eight  were used. The trolley  supports were designed to be attached to turnbuckles  which had beam clamps at  the top and were secured to the bridge stringers with 8 in. long bolts and 3\/4  in. nuts. The bottom of the turnbuckle was connected to 2 ton capacity  trolleys. The trolleys were positioned onto the platform trolley support  I-beams. Trolley wheels beneath the top flanges of the support beams suspended  the platform. The scaffold platform was moved approximately 5 ft at a time by  a rope and block come-along or wire rope tear fall  and then the fifth trolley  support was repositioned at the leading edges of the scaffold. Employees #1  and #2 had advanced the south platform and were repositioning the trolley  support beam clamps when the trolley supports detached from the I-beam.  Employee #1 fell into the water below and was killed. Employee #2 jumped and  grabbed the overhead structural steel wind bracing. The scaffold  still  anchored by three trolley supports at the northeast corner  swung in and  struck Employee #2's right leg  fracturing it. The platform swung in again and  hit Employee #2's left leg  causing ligament injuries. Employee #2 managed to  climb to the top of the steel  where he was rescued. Investigation revealed  that neither the employer nor the employees received any safety training  regarding the suspended traveler scaffolds. None of the employees were  familiar with its operation or had worked on this type of scaffolding. The  employer and employees used their own methods to advance the work platforms.  In addition  the employer had improperly modified the scaffolds and had not  provided guard railings  safety belts  safety nets  or a life saving skiff.     ",

LLC  was working at a construction  site where a new six-story apartment complex with two stories of underground  parking was being built. He was wearing a hard hat and had on his carpenter's  belt. He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building  under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches  wide and was not guarded on the north  south  and east sides. A gust of wind  or some other factor caused Employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to  a concrete floor area on the third floor below  a distance of approximately 10  feet 8.25 inches. He apparently did not strike or hit anything as he fell. He  landed between two 2-foot by 4-foot wood braces that were positioned 5 feet  1.25 inches apart on the third floor. He landed face down  striking his head  on the concrete floor approximately 4 feet 4 inches from a wood framed wall.  Employee #1's fall was witnessed by Coworker #1  who was working on the third  floor. Coworker #1 went to Employee #1 and got no response. He then went and  got help from one or more others at the work site. When they returned   Employee #1 was still unresponsive. There was a considerable amount of blood  pooled around Employee #1's head. Rescue personnel were called  and when they  arrived  they pronounced Employee #1 dead at the scene from massive head  trauma. The subsequent investigation established that Clark Builders Group LLC  was the general contractor for this work project. One of the subcontractors  was Agility Construction LLC  which had the framing contract. Agility  subcontracted all of the framing work to HAR Construction Co. LLC  with which  Agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project  manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the HAR employees) and  the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager  for Agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units  on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the Clark Builders Group officials.  HAR Construction Co. LLC had 52 employees working at this site. They had been  at the site since early January 2013. There were two foremen  two crew  leaders  16 carpenters  and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working  all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew  leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for HAR  Construction Co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups  of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out  where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the  rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto  the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall  Employee #1  was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the  investigation  Coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00  a.m. when Employee #1  while still up on the fourth floor  walked over near  the work area on the third floor where Coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1  told Employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber  and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an  area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece  of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to Coworker #1  from either inside or outside the guarded area. After Coworker #1 took the  lumber  Employee #1 told Coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third  floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform  nearby.
